If Japan's civilization had to be described by one visualisation, the famous picture of the huge
wave over Mount Fuji would probably work best. Thus, it could be argued that it has attained its
unparalleled cultural refinement (which is likely our best hope for long term survival in the cosmic
world) and military might (necessary to maintain our independence) through the natural facts of its
existence. Japan is once again prioritising its defense.
<br />
<br />
Korea's location between China, Russia and Japan forces it to balance between greater forces. In the
face of changing generational preferences North Korea is changing its peninsular policy, while South
Korea is increasing its regional influence, expressing willingness to work with "not like minded"
states and is proactively seeking a renewal of the international order.
