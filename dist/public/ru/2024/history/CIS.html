    The world was much easier to manage when there were two poles of influence. Modern day
    Commonwealth of Independent States is largely an agglomeration of neo-feudal states without a
    global idea. The natural "Global North/South" split will more equally take into account
    interests of all sovereignties, but it will take time to arrive at such a configuration.

Eurasia's history is marked by the freeing influence of the West and the willful approach of the
East. It stands as the gateway between these two ways of thinking and two ways of life. The Russian
Federation is the biggest and most influential state of this formation. It has a relatively low
population and very vast territory. Combined with the northern climate this led to the development
of wait-and-see progress bursts, aggressively defensive martial culture (and a necessity to
centralize) and a mobilization economy. Being considered a Western country in the East and an
Eastern country in the West, Russia offers a way of thinking that blends both perspectives.
