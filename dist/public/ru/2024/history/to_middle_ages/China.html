<br>
From the early beginnings of its history China has considered itself the middle land that exists in the midst of
relatively more barbarian surroundings. Until the Western Imperial expansion of the 19th century terms "the Middle
Kingdom" and then the more encompassing "All under Heaven" were common. For the bulk of the history of our civilizations
it has been the biggest economic and trade force on the planet. In the post-Imperial age the slogan "Striving for Unity"
is helping the Chinese people look past their differences and work towards social harmony. At the same time this concept
is used to proactively oppose the remaining Western influence over the Chinese state and its territories, including the
controversially debated Taiwan.

<br>
Besides unity the modern day Chinese culture is very much about prosperity. China is not interested in conquering its
surroundings and would rather enjoy economic leadership achieved through war-preempting means.
