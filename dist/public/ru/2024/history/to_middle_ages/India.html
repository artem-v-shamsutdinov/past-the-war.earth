                        <h2>The beginnings</h2>
                        <p>
                            Little is known of the inner workings of the Indus Valley civilization as the Harappan
                            script is yet to be deciphered. But we know that it traded with Mesopotamia as early as the
                            Sumer civilization, had plumbing thousands of years before Rome, as well as baked brick
                            houses and metallurgy. It spanned an area larger than contemporary Mesopotamian civilization
                            and was probably the most populous civilization on the planet at the time. Hindu texts and
                            Sanskrit epics talk of flying palaces or chariots in which Gods waged war on each other and
                            of a Adam's Bridge between India and Sri Lanka - an engineering project (if it was) beyond
                            the capacity of any early civilization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Indus Valley civilization eventually declined and disappeared due to gradual climate
                            change. For the same reason the Aryan migration from Central Asia technically marked the
                            start of the modern Indian civilization, though due to the gradual decline many elements of
                            the Indus Valley civilization made it into subsequent societies. The Indian religion of
                            Hinduism is considered to be the earliest religion and certainly takes roots in the Indus
                            Valley civilization. Modern day Hinduism is considered to be a synthesis of many Indian
                            cultures and traditions, without a single founding event. The moderating and compassionate
                            Buddhist ideology and the non-violent Jainism were created in India as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As in Mesopotamia, Indian kings were supposed to be great warriors capable of dominating
                            battlefields and conquering enemies and Hinduism indoctrinated war as a means of fulfilling
                            royal ambitions. It is also in Hinduism that we see the early concepts of a "just war" that
                            would avenge injustices and reclaim rights. Although not violent in nature Buddhism and
                            Jainism also allowed war, especially if it was led to defend one's own territories and
                            protecting the rights of citizens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 2,600 years ago small Indian chieftaincies consolidated into larger states. The first
                            big empire in India was the Nadna empire and was created about (arguably) 200 years after
                            that. The rumors of the size of the Nadna empire's army was the final straw that caused
                            Alexander the Great's soldiers to mutiny, turn around and withdraw from India. With time the
                            Indian subcontinent navies started to dominate the neighboring seas to protect trade routes
                            and prevent piracy as well as to conquer neighboring islands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some of the accounts describe the Nadna empire as a single-ruler monarchy, which would
                            explain its quest for territory and glory. But some Greek accounts suggest that it was more
                            of a federated state and these accounts are strengthened by Buddhist sources. Given the
                            Hindu ideology a federated state with a large degree of autonomy of constituent regions
                            makes more sense.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nanda kings never attempted to convert its conquered subjects to any leading ideology and
                            there is no evidence of any religious discrimination. It makes sense that such an inclusive
                            ideology and more decentralized governance suggest that Nadna conquests were less violent
                            than those of the first Mesopotamian empire. Such a claim is also supported by the long
                            history of the civilization of the Indian subcontinent, prior to the creation of the first
                            known empire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As is common with dynastic empires much depends on the one ruler's ability to govern. The
                            last Nanda king was widely unpopular.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Nanda empire was replaced by the Maurya empire 2350 years ago. It succeeded in covering
                            the bulk of the Indian subcontinent. It also ended up collapsing for the same reason of poor
                            leadership, combined with growing internal movement for independence as was common with the
                            heterogeneous Mesopotamian empires.
