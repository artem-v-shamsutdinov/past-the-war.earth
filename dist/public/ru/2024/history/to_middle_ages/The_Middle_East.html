History of AUKUS specifically and Western Civilization in general cannot be overviewed without first overviewing the history of the pre-colonial Middle East.  Islam, the last Western religion, took its roots here.  It decisively stated that God created the Universe, God is everywhere in the Universe and that Mohhamad is the last prophet, thus clearing the way for science.  Knowing that all beings in the Universe are below God will be critical in the coming ages, irrespective of what the balance of forces is in our Galaxy.
