  Rethought: The reasoning for invading Iraq has wider multifaceted regional
  basis and goes deeper than the misguided effort to remove a security threat or
  the blatant pursuit of an opportunistic war to solidify hegemony.

<br />
The Western Civilization starts with Greek democracy of the privileged many,
moves to the republic of the powerful few and goes to the more free vassage of
the chosen noble. The non-violent and universal Christianity played a critical
role in moderating the feudal rights and its subsequent relaxation added a
resource perspective to the subsequent Western expansion.

AUKUS is a security partnership between the USA, UK and Australia. The three
constituent countries of AUKUS descended from Great Britain, which developed the
fastest among the Western nations. Its geography acted as both a protective
barrier and as an incentive to have a more moderated, trade oriented outlook on
warfare.
