    After the bulk of the army will be armed with non-lethal, non-maming implements on land, seas naturally become the
    next
    fronteer. Cutting edge weapons will always be required at sea, just as they will allways be required by the coastal
    land
    covering maries, inland covering paratroopers and mountain covering special devisions (and special forces will
    always be
    special). But the it will be the maneuvering that will decide the outcomes of the decisive force training
    operations,
    for they will deal with planetary protection via a cultured approach of comparing capabilities.

    The seas specifically have always been about trade as much more economical to move goods by water than even by rail.
    But
    as we are soon to <a href="https://helionenergy.com">find out</a> there will be a new aspect to the seas -
    deuterium.
    The seas become the source of the bulk element of the future of energy, with the "catalyst" helium-3 being
    synthesised
    but possibly at a hefty premium or being mined on the Moon.

<p>
    The countries that will provide the bulk of sea protection are AUKUS - Atlantics and Pacific, Japan - Central
    Pacific,
    Russia - Arctic, North Pacific and the upcomers China - East Pacific and India - Indian.

    Historical trends

<p>
    Colonial, Imperial and Neo-colonial times naturally changed the behavior of the civilizations that will be in charge of securing the energy of the coming ages.  Thus it cannot be used to judge how they will behave going forward.  Based on the previous analysis of pre-colonial times here is what the security outlook appears to be:
