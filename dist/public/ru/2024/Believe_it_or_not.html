Regionalization that might work for everyone.
<br><br>
North America + AUKUS.
<br>
Plenty big in population and resources. Grouping in South America puts too much demographic strain on the USA.
North-East
Asia is too much of a competitor to be bundled in.
<br><br>
CIS + Koreas + Japan
<br>
Balance each other out in interests, resources and productive capacity. Balance with China, big enough and developed
enough for a technological zone.
<br><br>
China
<br>
Yep the whole China and nothing but China. It's got its problems but no way is it going to be out for long. It will have
to trade, of course.
<br><br>
NATO-EU
<br>
Eastern-Western split has proven to not work. Brits don't want in. But everyone else is happy enough to stick together.
<br><br>
South Asia
<br>
Gotta align Afghanistan with someone - and its right in India's neighborhood. Add Pakistan on one end and Bangladesh on
the other and there is a balance of interests. Beats having China come in, overextend and make a mess of all of Asia.
<br><br>
Africa and the Middle East
<br>
They are already intermingled and just might be big enough to make a sustainable technological zone.
<br><br>
South America & South East Asia
<br>
South East Asia has lots of potential but is overshadowed by India and China. South America by
itself is just too small. Together they might just have enough weight (with necessitated AUKUS cover).
<br><br><br>
And make these regional blocks responsible for securing their cross-block trade.
