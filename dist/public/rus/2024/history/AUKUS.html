                The reasoning for invading Iraq has wider multifaceted
                regional basis and goes deeper than the misguided effort to
                remove a security threat or the blatant pursuit of an
                opportunistic war to solidify hegemony.

              The Western Civilization starts with Greek democracy of the
              privileged many, moves to the republic of the powerful few and
              goes to the more free vassage of the chosen noble. The
              non-violent and universal Christianity played a critical role in
              moderating the feudal rights and its subsequent relaxation added
              a resource perspective to subsequent Western expansion.

              AUKUS is a security partnership between the USA, UK and
              Australia. The three constituent countries of AUKUS descended
              from Great Britain, which developed the fastest among the
              Western nations. Its geography acted as both a protective
              barrier and as an incentive to have a more moderated, trade
              oriented outlook on warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
              AUKUS is a stable, potentially long-lasting military alliance
              because its members:

            <ul>
              <li>Do not compete for supremacy in the alliance</li>

            <h2>Britain</h2>
            <h3>Early History</h3>
            <p>
              Agriculture was initially introduced to the British Isles around
              6000 years ago. It became widespread in the Bronze Age, starting
              about 4500 years ago. The Stonehenge was constructed between
              5100 and 2600 years ago with the large stones being placed
              between 4600 and 4400 years ago. By around 3600 years ago
              British tin was exported across Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              The British Iron age started about 2800 years ago after the
              collapse of the Bronze Age civilization and trade routes. At the
              same time Britain developed close ties with nearby Continental
              Europe. During this time Celtic languages spread throughout the
              British Isles. During this time brochs and hillforts became
              widespread in Britain. By 2100 years ago the population of Great
              Britain could have been as large as 3-4 million, mostly
              concentrated in the agricultural lands of the South. The land
              was covered by tribal kingdoms, associated with various
              hillforts. Celtic societies had a priestly class of Druids that
              acted as religious and legal authorities. By 2050 years ago
              Britain had established diplomatic and trade relations with
              Rome.
            </p>
            <h3>Roman period</h3>
            <p>
              Starting with the mid 1st century and until the early 5th
              century most of Great Britain was under Roman rule. Roman
              occupation was met with widespread rebellion and several
              invasion attempts by neighboring forces, and for much of Roman
              history of Great Britain a large garrison force was stationed on
              the island. Because of a large concentration of military forces
              in Britain it created an alternate "power-center" in the Roman
              Empire, sometimes shifting its loyalties to various groups of
              Roman elites during the many internal Roman struggles for
              control. The north of the island was never conquered by the
              Romans and defensive fortifications had to be maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 5th century due to continuing struggles for
              internal control Roman military presence was withdrawn from
              Britain. Subsequently the control of Britain fragmented. Per
              British tradition to assist in fighting against existing foes
              Saxons were invited into the island. By the turn of the 7th
              century Saxons occupied part of Britain and many Britons fled to
              areas outside of the island.
            </p>
            <h3>Early Medieval period</h3>
            <p>
              In the 5th and 6th centuries Anglo-Saxon immigrants increasingly
              began settling in Britain. This led to the spread of the Old
              English language (replaced by Middle English in mid 12th
              century, Early Modern English in mid 15th century and Late
              Modern English at the turn of the 19th century) and the creation
              of the English cultural identity. The culture of English
              superiority to the "backwards" Celtic fringes of Wales, Scotland
              and Cornwell began in the 12th and 13th centuries. In the 13th
              century English colonisation started in Wales.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 7th century the Anglo-Saxons converted to Christianity
              (after the initial Roman efforts of the late 4th century). Also
              in the 7th century the Kingdom of Mercia controlled much of
              England though competition for control of territory continued
              through the 8th century. In the late 8th century Vikings began
              raiding Great Britain. From mid 9th to the mid 11th centuries a
              struggle for territorial control ensued between the local forces
              and Vikings. The English navy was first mentioned in the mid 9th
              century and became important at the turn of the 13th century
              (after the loss of Normandy).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Kingdom of England was formed in the early 10th century and
              by the mid 11th century England was a strong, centralized state.
              At that time England was violently conquered by Normans, which
              replaced the elite structure of the country. The Normans
              introduced the feudal system and abolished slavery. In the 12th
              and 13th centuries infighting among the Anglo-Norman elites led
              to a multitude of civil wars.
            </p>
            <h3>Medieval period</h3>
            <p>
              In the early 13th century in an attempt to restore peace British
              elites signed the Magna Carta, temporarily decentralizing
              previously purely monarchical rule among the highest level of
              elites. In the early to mid 13th century the decline of
              feudalism led to the culture of ruling councils evolving into
              early annual Parliaments, with the concept of representation
              introduced with inclusion of proctors of clergy. In the late
              13th century the Commons of knights and burgesses began to be
              summoned regularly. Starting with the mid 14th century
              Parliament became an important institution in England and the
              Upper and Lower Chambers were established. The modern structure
              of the English Parliament was established in the 16th century,
              with the monarchs increasingly realizing that they needed
              parliament to legitimise the majority of their decisions. First
              general elections were first run at the turn of the 19th century
              and universal suffrage was introduced in the 1920s.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 14th century the Great Famine and the Black Death killed
              around half of England's population. Hardships caused by this
              and following events led to the Peasants' Revolt in the late
              14th century. In the 14th and 15th centuries British entered the
              offensive Hundred Years' War with France which eventually
              resulted in a military failure. In the mid 15th century a
              sequence of bloody civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses.
            </p>
            <h3>Tudor period</h3>
            <p>
              In the 16th century the British elites forced the Church of
              England to break away from the Catholic Church. A number of
              internal and external inter-elite and armed conflicts were
              associated with this process. Known as the English Reformation
              it resulted in increased sovereignty of the English state.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 16th century the English navy greatly expanded and
              became a permanent force. This provided an effective deterrent
              against foreign invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The recognizable roots of modern day English culture are traced
              to this period.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the late 15th century and 16th century six Anglo-French
              Wars took place. In the late 16th century Spain attempted a
              massive naval invasion of Britain, which was successfully
              repelled by the British fleet. Subsequently British colonization
              of the Americas started in the late 16th century, with the first
              successful colony established in the early 17th century.
            </p>
            <h3>Stuart period</h3>
            <p>
              In the mid 17th century, after a period of personal rule by
              divine right a series of large-scale civil wars took place in
              Britain. During them a short-lived republic was established. As
              a result of this a common understanding was reached that neither
              the English monarch nor the Parliament could govern alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the republic the first English standing army was
              established. Defence pressure against large standing armies of
              Spain and France caused permanent re-establishment of the
              standing army by the late 17th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in the late 17th century supremacy of the Parliament over
              the monarchs was established with the adoption of Bills of
              Rights in England and Scotland, with a philosophical agreement
              that all of the country's elites should have consent.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 18th century Acts of the Union created the Kingdom
              of Great Britain. Before then England and Scotland were separate
              countries with the same ruler for over a century. This greatly
              reduced the risk of war between the two states.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 17th century three Anglo-Dutch Wars took place due to
              political disputes and increasing trade competition, with the
              Dutch gaining advantage in the short term. During the entire
              Stuart period England continued its series of armed conflicts
              with the increasingly dominating France, making alliances with
              other European naval and land powers. With the Dutch being tied
              in a land war in Europe, England came out of the period as the
              stronger colonial sovereignty.
            </p>
            <h3>Georgian era</h3>
            <p>
              By the early 18th century Britain was the most prosperous nation
              in the world, with the focus not on territorial expansion but on
              building a worldwide trading network. This led to development of
              the most capable fleet in the world and development of trading
              monopolies such as the East India Company, which colonised
              India, and the Royal African Company which focused on the slave
              trade. The policy of Mercantilism was imposed on the colonies
              which promoted partnership between merchants and the government
              to increase political power and private wealth, while stifling
              development of rival empires.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of a global conflict with France in the mid 18th
              century the "First" British Empire became the dominant colonial
              sovereignty of the world and ended with the loss of the American
              Revolutionary War. The subsequent "Second" British Empire
              compensated for the loss of American colonies by colonizing
              Australia and New Zealand and focusing on Asia. In the early
              19th century the East India Company gained control of the bulk
              of India through conquest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in the early 19th century Britain worked with the United
              States to institute the Monroe Doctrine. This had the effect of
              blocking other colonial powers from expanding colonies in the
              New World and directly benefited Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 18th century the Industrial Revolution started in
              Britain, which by then was the leading commercial sovereignty
              (with the development of trade and business being the main
              causes). By the late 18th century industrialization became a
              rapid process, with the rate of development slowing down by the
              mid 19th century. In parallel Britain underwent an Agricultural
              Revolution which contributed to rapid growth of population.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the turn of the 19th century Great Britain and Ireland united
              and the slave trade was abolished. In the middle of the 19th
              century slavery was abolished in the entirety of the British
              Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the mid 18th century Britain was in a period of continual
              warfare, with France being the main opponent. Britain won most
              conflicts, with the notable exception of the American
              Revolution. Starting with the beginning of the 19th century the
              Royal Navy was the overwhelming naval force on the planet
              leading to a long period of relative peace for the British
              Empire and the Pax Britannica lasting from the Napoleonic Wars
              and until World War I.

            <h3>Victorian era</h3>
            <p>
              In the mid 19th century the Great Famine in Ireland highlighted
              the failures of British colonial policy. While being involved in
              many armed conflicts, during the Victorian era Britain did not
              experience any conflicts with other colonial empires until the
              end of the 19th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 19th century Britain took steps to prevent
              revolutionary scenarios like what happened in France at the end
              of the 18th century. In the mid 19th century monarchy had to
              accept the post of the Prime Minister with the Westminster
              (cabinet) system of government. The representation of the
              professional and business middle-class also improved greatly. In
              the late 19th century representation improved for the working
              class as well. In effect revolutionary reforms took place,
              largely peacefully.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the mid 19th century Britain was considered to be the
              "workshop of the world", made possible by free trade
              imperialism. In the late 19th century the industrialization of
              the United States, Germany and Japan led to decline of British
              industrial supremacy. In the 19th century, while largely
              abstaining from affairs of continental Europe, Brittain exerted
              major political and economic influence throughout Latin America
              and Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 19th century to prevent the growth in influence of
              the Russian Empire, which could result in the collapse of the
              Ottoman Empire, scramble for its territory and start a
              large-scale war, Britain (and France) intervened in the Crimean
              War. In the late 19th century Britain along with the western
              European great powers intervened politically to prevent complete
              defeat of the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empire. Throughout
              the 19th century the British Empire competed with the Russian
              Empire for influence in Central Asia in a rivalry known as the
              Great Game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in the mid 19th century, during the American Civil War, the
              British elite supported the Confederate States of America due
              their status as a resource base for the British textile
              industry. The possibility of British intervention on behalf of
              the Confederacy ended when the end to slavery was announced by
              the Union as a war goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 19th century the British Empire fought the Opium wars
              with Imperial China. At about the same time the East India
              Company continued annexation of various parts of the Indian
              subcontinent and fought wars with local forces. After a
              large-scale Indian rebellion the territorial control of India
              was transferred to the British Crown. This started the long
              period of British Raj, which lasted until 1947. Partially due to
              mismanagement during the overall British rule (and especially in
              the late 19th century) India suffered a number of horrible
              famins.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the late 19th century the British Empire fought against the
              Egyptian and Sudanese forces in a conflict that resulted in a
              long term British occupation of Egypt. This occupation altered
              the balance of power in the world, fostering the dominance of
              British interests in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle
              East.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in the late 19th century the German Empire started gaining
              potential. This led to a naval race between the Britain Empire
              and the German Empire. At this time Britain restored good
              relations with France and the United States and improved
              relations with the Russian Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in the late 19th century Britain unified its North American
              colonies as the Dominion of Canada. From the mid 19th century
              and until the start of World War I the British Empire
              participated in the Western European colonial scramble for
              Africa. It fought wars against Mahdists, the Zulu Kingdom and
              Dutch colonists in South Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Victorian era the British Empire was also involved in
              a large number of other lesser known armed conflicts, many of
              them related to colonial domination.
            </p>
            <h3>Modern times</h3>
            <p>
              In the first decade of the 20th century the British Empire was
              involved in a number of colonial conflicts, maintaining its
              dominant status. Between 1910 and 1914 the British Empire
              suffered a number of domestic issues, including potential
              refusal of orders by the Army in Ireland.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1914 Britain entered WWI to protect Belgium. Its army fought
              on the Western Front against the Imperial German Army. The Royal
              Navy led campaigns against German colonial possessions and
              blockaded Germany proper.
            </p>
            <p>
              The losses from unsuccessful offensive campaigns and lack of
              volunteers caused Britain to institute conscription in 1916.
              Entry of the United States on the side of the Allies provided
              the necessary fighting force and resources to compensate for
              Allied war exhaustion. The war was won by the Allies in 1918
              with over 1,100,000 fatal casualties in the British Imperial
              Forces and over 100,000 civilian fatalities. World War I forever
              disillusioned the British public to the glorified image of war
              and created a sentiment that wars should never be fought again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Immediately after WWI Britain fought in Estonian and Latvian
              wars for independence, in the Russian Civil War intervention, in
              the Turkish War of Independence and a number of colonial
              conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1916 an unsuccessful uprising took place in Ireland. Between
              1919 and 1921 the Irish Republican Army waged a guerilla war. In
              1922 Ireland was partitioned with the north remaining in the
              United Kingdom and the south becoming the Irish Free State.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of WWI Britain was granted mandates over Palestine
              and Iraq and gained two German African colonies. Iraq became
              independent in 1932. Egypt became independent in 1922 but
              remained occupied by British forces until 1936, with the Suez
              Canal zone being occupied until 1956. Not having sustained a
              direction in the development of the region (between the world
              wars) the British Empire fought in a number of colonial
              conflicts in the Middle East, including Arab revolts and Jewish
              insurgency.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1931 a large number of British colonies became legislatively
              autonomous with the creation of the British Commonwealth of
              Nations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1939 Britain declared war against Nazi Germany in response to
              the occupation of Poland. British forces were rapidly defeated
              in the Far East by Imperial Japan which showed the inability of
              the empire to defend all of its territories. This pushed
              Australia and New Zealand into closer security agreements with
              the United States in 1951. The war also weakened the empire in
              India. In general the British Empire was severely weakened as a
              result of the war. Close to 400,000 military personnel and
              70,000 civilians were killed on the side of Britain. 150,000
              military personnel and 300,000 civilians were killed on the side
              of the Commonwealth. India lost 87,000 military personnel and
              between 1,500,000 and 3,800,000 civilians (largely due to
              war-caused famine).
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of the weakening of the British Empire in WWII its
              colonies in Africa and Asia became increasingly nationalistic.
              The secondary role of the British Empire in the Cold War became
              apparent in the Suez Crisis of 1956. By 1965 the British
              colonies with the vast majority of the imperial population
              gained independence. The majority of British colonies achieved
              independence by 1984, with Australia and New Zealand severing
              their constitutional ties in 1986. Hong Kong was handed over to
              the PRC in 1997. Today Britain retains sovereignty over 14
              territories outside of the British Isles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The United Kingdom was a member of the European Union from 1973
              to 2020. In 2121 the UK joined the AUKUS security partnership,
              after 80 years of joint intelligence cooperation and security
              cooperation in multiple wars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since World War II the United Kingdom has been involved in or
              led 36 international armed conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>The UK performed 45 nuclear tests between 1957 and 1991.</p>
            <h2>The United States</h2>
            <p>
              First successful English settlement in North America was made in
              the beginning of the 17th century. The last of the Thirteen
              colonies was established in the beginning of the 18th century.
              Early immigration to the colonies was led by immigration of
              people seeking religious freedom and by transport of convicts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The thirteen British colonies declared their independence in the
              late 18th century and successfully fought the related
              revolutionary war. The new Union rejected monarchy and set up a
              republic based on a balance of power between 3 branches of
              government.
            </p>
            <p>
              From its colonial history and into the early 20th century the
              United States fought a number of wars for control of territory
              with the indigenous peoples, with catastrophic loss of life on
              the part of the natives. Until the mid 19th century the United
              States continued to expand its continental territory via a
              number of purchases, cessions and wars.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 19th century developed the Monroe Doctrine of
              preventing European powers from further colonization of or
              interference in the Americas.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 19th century the United states went through a civil
              war between the industrialized North and the agrarian,
              separatist South, with the North winning. As a result of the war
              the Union was restored and slavery was abolished. An unknown
              number of civilians and close to 750,000 soldiers died in the
              Civil War.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the Civil War the United States experienced the Second
              Industrial Revolution that lasted until WWI. By the turn of the
              20th century the United States was far ahead of Britain (the
              second biggest industrial sovereignty).
            </p>
            <p>
              Between the mid 19th century and early 20th century the United
              States experienced large-scale in-migration. Present day illegal
              immigration combined with existing demographic trends will
              likely change US foreign policy by the 2050s towards more focus
              on the Americas with a particular focus on North America.
            </p>
            <p>
              The United States entered World War I in 1917 and decisively
              changed the balance of forces in favor of the Allies by 1918.
              The United States suffered close to 117,000 war deaths in WWI.
            </p>
            <p>
              After WWI the United States (along with the rest of the world)
              experienced economic depression and became isolationist in its
              foreign policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The United States entered World War II in 1941, initially in the
              Pacific region of the world. It entered the war in continental
              Europe in 1944. As a result of WWII the United States emerged as
              the leading military power in the world, competing for dominance
              with the Soviet Union until 1991. Subsequently it became the
              world hegemon until the present day conflicts. The United States
              suffered over 410,000 fatal casualties in WWII.
            </p>
            <p>
              After WWII the United States underwent a Civil Rights Movement
              which ensured the rights of descendants of its former slave
              population.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between 1945 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 the United
              States led the Western Alliance in the Cold War and successfully
              won it. It occupied the main Axis powers of WWII and established
              a network of military bases throughout the planet. The United
              States began a rollback of its military presence in the world in
              the 2010s with the trend becoming fully apparent after the end
              of the US military mission in Afghanistan in 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Vietnam War of 1955 to 1975 disillusioned the United States
              public of the righteous image of freedom defending warfare. The
              United States suffered over 58,000 military fatal casualties in
              the Vietnam War.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since WWII the United States has led or been involved in 33
              military conflicts.

            <p>
              The United States performed 1,054 nuclear weapons tests between
              1945 and 1992. Twice it used nuclear weapons in combat in 1945.

            <h2>Australia</h2>
            <p>
              The first known European landing in Australia dates to the turn
              of the 17th century. It was claimed for Great Britain in the
              late 18th century with a subsequent establishment of a penal
              colony. In the following century a number of colonies were
              established by the British across the continent. By the mid 19th
              century the settler population numbered over a million and
              started to approach 4 million by the turn of the 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              Warfare between Aboriginal groups and the colonists took place
              until the early 20th century. Throughout the colonization
              process a number of massacres against the native population took
              place. Much of the Aboriginal population died of exposure with
              the diseases brought by the British colonists and due to the
              loss of hunting grounds and starvation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1901 the separate colonies united into a federation. In 1926
              the Balfour Declaration issued at the Imperial Conference stated
              that British dominions were autonomous. In 1931 the the passing
              of the Statue of Westminster by the British Parliament prevented
              Britain from making laws for its dominions. It was ratified by
              Australia in 1942.
            </p>
            <p>
              Australian forces aided the British Empire in WWI and WWII.
              Australia suffered over 60,000 killed in WWI and over 27,000
              killed in WWII.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since WWII Australia has been involved in 20 wars and armed
              conflicts.
