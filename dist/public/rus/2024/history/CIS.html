                                The world was much easier to manage when there were two poles of
                                influence. Modern day
                                Commonwealth of Independent States is largely an agglomeration of
                                neo-feudal states without a
                                global idea. The natural "Global North/South" split will more
                                equally take into account
                                interests of all sovereignties, but it will take time to arrive at
                                such a configuration.

                            Eurasia's history is marked by the freeing influence of the West and the
                            willful approach of the
                            East. It stands as the gateway between these two ways of thinking and
                            two ways of life. The Russian
                            Federation is the biggest and most influential state of this formation.
                            It has a relatively low
                            population and very vast territory. Combined with the northern climate
                            this led to the development
                            of wait-and-see progress bursts, aggressively defensive martial culture
                            (with a necessity to
                            centralize) and a mobilization economy. Being considered a Western
                            country in the East and an
                            Eastern country in the West, Russia offers a way of thinking that blends
                            both perspectives.

                            Historically Russia has been a European state. However its history
                            differs drastically from that the bulk of Europe:
                        </p>
                        <h3>Early Middle Ages</h3>
                        <p>
                            Due to the compact size of Europe (primarily agricultural) lands were
                            claimed early on in medieval history. Thus development of Feudalism in
                            Western and Central Europe involved nobles expropriating land from
                            agricultural communities in exchange for protection. This led to the
                            development of the class of knights, which combined with early
                            introduction of organized Catholicism led to the development of codified
                            law. By the mid 11th century the medieval system of Feudalism was
                            already formed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast to that early Rus' was located in the frontier steppes,
                            having to defend against large groups of nomads. Defence required a
                            greater number of armed warriors, which led to the total armament of
                            agricultural and urban communities. Logically, an armed population
                            cannot be easily exploited.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast to Europe, until the mid 11th century the main source of
                            wealth of Russian princes were tradable assets and slaves, due to the
                            north-south river trade route through Rus' into the Byzantine empire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, being a steppe frontier, Rus' had available unoccupied land. Thus
                            until the mid 11th century nobility wasn't as involved in expropriation
                            of lands from communities - their domains continued to grow.
                            Subsequently expropriation of land increased, which is evidenced by a
                            number of armed rebellions of the following period.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Possibly, the high degree of connectivity of elites in the totality of
                            the Rus' lands prevented codification of law, since informal agreements
                            were sufficiently enforceable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus the pre-Mongol invasion Rus' did not develop into a Feudal society
                            and remained in the late stage of the "barbarian" system, with elements
                            of communal tribalism remaining (possibly never heading for the
                            western-style Feudal path of development).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Middle Ages</h3>
                        <p>
                            From the mid 11th century and into the 13th century the West went
                            through an equivalent of an Industrial Revolution. This is evident by
                            the large increases in the number of built windmills. From the mid 12th
                            century the construction of gothic cathedrals required large scale
                            mining of stone, technological development and specialization. In turn
                            this led to increased intellectual development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time Catholic Europe experienced the struggle for control
                            between the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and Papacy. This gave
                            enough time for the French monarchy to establish itself and become
                            another force in competition with Catholic control. Subsequently the
                            development of influential Italian trade sovereignties (with focus on
                            diplomacy and secret intelligence) also played a role in furthering
                            development of Europe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time prior to the arrival of the Mongol invasion force the
                            development of Rus' did not take it to the Feudal system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the 13th to the 15th century Europe entered into a period of crisis,
                            reaching a development of ideological and economic plateau. Feudalism
                            progressed from direct exploitation of humans (serfs) to exploitation of
                            the land. This new, external factor of exploitation eased the subsequent
                            transition to another external factor of exploitation - capital. These
                            developments were greatly affected by the Black Death plague, which
                            combined with greater exploitation by the nobiles led to a de facto
                            anti-feudal revolution in the late 14th century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently in the 15th century nobiles gradually started to lose their
                            influence. In order to retain it the majority of nobles in the leading
                            monarchical domains chose to align with the monarchies against the free
                            gentry, which was growing in influence. These were the "new monarchies"
                            (more central and punitive) that later became the basis of creation of
                            the state system of early modernity. The development of this system
                            began to replace the previous repressive (and organising) functions that
                            were built into the economic systems of slavery and feudalism and came
                            in parallel with the genesis of capitalism, which made the economic
                            relationship between the capitalist and the worker an exchange of work
                            for payment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the Rus' territories of the 13th century another crisis unfolded. The
                            system of the Golden Horde was established and changed which completely
                            changed the character of most institutions in Rus'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the pre-Mongolian Rus' there was a triangular balance between Veche
                            (parliament), Prince and the Boyars (Barons). In some principalities
                            (Pskov, Novgorod, Vyatka) the parliament held more influence making for
                            oligarchic leaning systems, in others (Galicia-Volhynia, Kiev) the
                            Boyars were dominating and in yet others (Suzdal', Vladimir) the
                            Princes. In none of the principalities of pre-Mongolian Rus' did the
                            Princes have enough power to dominate both the parliament and the
                            barons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the arrival of the Golden Horde Princes could summon additional
                            forces from the Horde. As a result of this the parliaments disappeared
                            in the Rus' states that were vassalages of the Horde. The struggle
                            between the barons and the prince also diminished because of the
                            necessity of union between the two to successfully prosper in
                            competition against the other vassalages of the Horde. Hence instead of
                            the competition between the nobles and the monarchy (observed in the
                            West) on Rus' a completely different, oligarchic concept of baron-prince
                            combine takes place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most effective of these combines was organized in Muscovy
                            principality (first a minor territory of a larger vassalage) which as
                            result became the representative of the Horde on Rus'. In turn, because
                            of that it gained leadership in Rus' (not because of the beneficial
                            placement near trade routes or being the leader of the struggle to
                            liberate Rus', with its only major military engagement against the Horde
                            being against an usurper who was not a legitimate ruler).

                        <p>
                            In the mid 15th century Muscovy began to prepare for the struggle to
                            inherit the influence of the Golden Horde, which by then was noticeably
                            weakened. In preparation for armed conflicts it reformed its government
                            and separated military functions for economic ones. Thus the real reason
                            why Muscovy became the inheritor of the Golden Horde was its strong
                            military administrative organization, that from that point on could
                            exist only by expansion (thus becoming an empire).

                        <h3>Transition of systems</h3>
                        <p>
                            From the mid 15th century there was a drastic difference between the
                            development of the elites in the West and Russia. Western elites formed
                            in the conditions of intense social competition from the top down, vs
                            Russian elites where always capped by either the Golden Horde or later
                            the Tzars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the Renaissance and Reformation the united (North) Atlantic World
                            system was formed. This added a proto-capitalist sea born entity in the
                            "long 16th century" which added a flow of resources that was first and
                            foremost was invested in military needs. This new historical entity was
                            needed to transition from the Feudal system to the Capitalist system and
                            first manifested itself in England and eventually became apparent in all
                            of Europe, with almost all European colonial powers playing a key role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the "long 16th century" this new historical entity led to
                            development of three systems which subsequently competed for dominance.
                            In the French version the peasants and monarchy dominated nobility,
                            which developed a highly institutionalized state separated from the
                            ruling elite. In the German lands version where the ruling dominated the
                            peasantry and monarchy, which developed a highly institutionalized state
                            closely tied with the ruling elite. The English version developed a
                            weakly institutionalized state separated from the ruling elite.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This historical entity created the State (repression/control system) and
                            Capital (exchange based economic system), with the subsequent
                            development of European history marking the beginning of evolution of
                            Capitalism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The end of this period in Europe is marked by the end of the religious
                            Thirty Year War and the English Civil War.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Russia, after the end of the domination of the Golden Horde, this
                            period started with capturing the lands of Novgorod and distribution of
                            its lands to lower nobility. This breaks the baron-prince combine and
                            creates contradictions between the barons and nobility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 16th century the need to centralize the growing state became
                            apparent and the old oligarchic-combine system of governance created a
                            multitude of problems. This was resolved by creation of the emergency
                            commission known as "oprichnina", which suppressed the problematic
                            combine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus in the middle of the 17th century in the West the entities of State
                            (repression/control system) and Capital (exchange based economic system)
                            were formed at the same time as Overseeing Autocracy was formed in
                            Russia, which isn't an early modern state or a form of Feudalism. It
                            becomes an overseeing construct which is above the government and the
                            law.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This led to rebellion which was suppressed by the lower nobility and
                            economic elites. To pay for the gained stability the autocracy initiated
                            the institute of serfdom (in the mid 17th century). This serfdom
                            included city dwellers and forced nobility into service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus in this period saw the State/Capital system start a maritime
                            expansion while the Overseeing Autocracy started land based expansion,
                            starting a period of two mirroring North Western/Eastern systems with
                            corresponding subjects of the times: Hegemony of Holland on sea and
                            Tsardom of Muscovy in the eastern lands; British Empire and Russian
                            Empire; USA and USSR.

                        <h2>Russian beginnings</h2>
                        <p>
                            We know of the Korchak, Penkovka, Kolochin, and Kyiv cultures of the 2rd
                            to 6th centuries, with the earliest being the Kiev culture.
                            Kievan/Kyivan Rus' is the first known eastern slavic state. It was
                            formed in the 9th century from a variety of Slavic, Norse and Finnic
                            tribes. The name Rus' originates from the Viking rulers that were
                            invited from the region of modern day St. Petersburg to reign in
                            Novgorod in late 862 (who were already at war with the Byzantine Empire
                            from the early 9th century). Kievan/Kyivan Rus' was formed by movement
                            from the Novgorod region southward to control the trade routes from
                            Khazar raids. The western migration of various nomadic tribes in the 8th
                            century caused instability in the Khazar Khaganate causing conflicts
                            with the Rus' and Slavs that were previously Khazars against Arab raids.
                            The city of Kyiv/Kiev was a slavic settlement dating to the 5th century
                            on a major trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople when it
                            was a Khazar tributary. After it was captured by the Novgorodians it
                            became Rus' capital.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Kievan Rus'</h3>
                        <p>
                            Over the course of the 9th century Kyiv conquered the bulk of the
                            Eastern Slavic tribes, imposing tribute on them. After the Rus' attack
                            on Constantinople in 860 Byzantium sent missionaries to convert them and
                            Slavs to Christianity. After subsequent Rus' attacks a peace treaty
                            between the Byzantine Empire and the Rus' was signed in 945. After a
                            series of conflicts in the late 10th century Rus' was Christianized in
                            the late 980s, more forcibly in the North than in the South. After the
                            Great Schism of 1054 Rus' maintained communion with Rome and
                            Constantinople eventually following the East Orthodox faith.

                        <p>
                            Internal conflicts continued into the 11th century with the position of
                            Kyiv weakening as regional clans grew in influence. The Kievan Rus' fell
                            fragmented and declined in the 12th century. In the early 13th century
                            it was devastated by the invasion (with northwest avoiding destruction)
                            by the Mongol Empire with most Rus' principalities being forced to
                            submit to Mongol rule, with the exception of Novgorod Republic and a few
                            others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fragmentation of Kievan Rus' led to the independence of Novgorod. Unlike
                            the Price run Kievan Rus', Novgorod was a Republic, enabled by its
                            status as a regional trade center. It had an institution of Veche
                            (modernly represented by the word "soviet") which was present in the
                            tribal assemblies predating the Rus' state. It was the highest
                            legislative and judicial authority in Novgorod until late the 15th
                            century. It was a lower chamber of the parliament with the upper chamber
                            being made up of the former magistrate members. The economic power was
                            centered in the hands of wealthy merchants. Veches also existed in Pskov
                            (farther West) and modern day Poland and had similarities to the peasant
                            republics of Scandinavia. Princes were invited to Novgorod for the
                            purpose of protection and were mostly military leaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Novgorod has been in conflict with the Swedish, Danish and German
                            crusaders since the 12th century, famously defeating the Livonian Order
                            in mid 12th century at the Battle on the Ice. Kievan Rus' ended with the
                            invasion of Mongols, who devastated the land and its people. Novgord was
                            saved from Mongol pillaging and paid tribute to the Golden Horde.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Consolidation by Moscow</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Grand Duchy of Moskovy started as a vassal state to the Golden Horde
                            in the late 13th century. At the beginning of the 14th century Moskovy
                            started to expand. After an intermarriage with the Golden Horde khans
                            and became the most influential principality in Rus'. At about the same
                            time the leadership of the Russian Orthodox church moved to Moscow.
                            Subsequently the principality continued close cooperation with the khans
                            and started to collect tribute from other principalities on their
                            behalf, using the new found wealth to further expand its borders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently Moscow survived a territorial conflict with the Grand Duchy
                            of Lithuania to the west. And subsequently after expanding the influence
                            of the Russian Orthodox Church Muscovy rulers used its influence to
                            unite the warring Rus' principalities against the Golden Horde. At the
                            Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 Moskovy forces defeated the Horde only to be
                            sacked two years later. After a period of uncertainty the relations with
                            the Horde improved while Moscow expanded further East and North. It set
                            up a network of monasteries that allowed for economic control of the
                            surrounding area and expanded Moscow's influence on the surrounding
                            principalities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid-15th century Moscovy went through a civil war as a result of
                            which the control re-solidified and Moscow expanded further.
                            Subsequently in the second half of 15th century Moscow solidified
                            unquestioned control over the other principalities and successfully
                            battled for sovereignty from the Golden Horde, and gained territory in
                            the west after a number of inconclusive Russo-Lithuanian wars (and
                            tripled in size). In a struggle against nobility the state centralized
                            in the 16th century and conducted ideologically motivated purges by
                            instituting Russia's first political police. Russia gained a standing
                            army, started the wars with the Ottoman empire and expanded further by
                            conquering Kazan in the East and Astrakhan in the South East (though
                            lost some western territories).
                        </p>
                        <h2>To the East of Poland</h2>
                        <p>
                            Balts settled the area East of Poland in the 5th century though there
                            are 1st century Roman accounts of peoples that were possibly Balts.
                            Lithuanians were one of the Balt peoples, with modern Estonians (first
                            mentioned in 1st century) and Latvians (territorially identifiable
                            towards the end of first millennium of Common Era) also belonging to the
                            same group. The Lithuanians are also thought to have emerged towards the
                            end of the first millennium. In 9th to 11th centuries future Lithuania
                            was a tributary to Denmark and from 10th to 11th centuries to the Kievan
                            Rus'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the 11th century Rus' and Lithuanias were mutually invading each
                            other. From the 12th century Poles and Lithuanians were sporadically
                            raiding each other and from late 12th century a Lithuanian military
                            force existed. Lithuanian statehood existed from the early 13th century
                            with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania forming in 1236 at the same time as
                            the Crusade organized against the then pagan Balts. A period of
                            ideological turbulence ensued where the rulers were Western Christian,
                            pagan and Eastern Christian.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lithuania also suffered from the Mongol invasion (though to a lesser
                            degree than more eastern Rus') and paid tribute. Under the pressure from
                            the (later merged) Livonian and Teutonic Orders, Lithuania maintained
                            ties with the Pope but avoided conversion and remained a pagan-ruled.
                            Lithuania used the collapse of the Kievan Rus' to expand into its
                            territories as it competed with The Grand Duchy of Muscovy. In the 14th
                            and 15th centuries Lithuania covered most of modern Belarus and Ukraine
                            and stretched to the Black Sea.

                            Only 10 percent of its territory was ethnically Lithuanian and it
                            depended on its Ruthenian (Rus') lands and people. The Ruthenian prices
                            were Orthodox Christians and many Lithuanian prices also adopted the
                            Eastern Orthodox religion. This way the capital Vilnius was transformed
                            into a center of the Kievan Rus' civilization. Though the grand duke
                            remained pagan until the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387 to the
                            Latin faith because of an alliance and subsequently a marital union with
                            Poland which provided protection from the Teutonic Knights.

                            Lithuania could have also aligned with the Grand Duchy of Moscow but it
                            was too distant and was competing for the loyalties of the Ruthenian
                            prices. Due to the conversion to Catholicism the Pope prohibited
                            Teutonic Knights from warring with Lithuania, which eventually helped to
                            neutralize their threat. After a period of civil war Teutonic attacks
                            were repelled with the help from Poland and the previously loose
                            confederation of territories united for protection began to centralize.

                            After a period of expansion and an attempt to subjugate all of Ruthenia
                            at the end of the 14th century Lithuania suffered a defeat by the Golden
                            Horde and the need for a permanent alliance with Poland became
                            apparent.  In the early 16th century the Polish-Lithuanian forces
                            entered into a series of wars with the Grand Duchy of Moscow (which
                            attempted to gather the former lands of the Kievan Rus') and resulted in
                            loss of territory.  This loss of territory and the wars with the
                            Teutonic Order caused the creation of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in
                            the mid 16th century with many Lithuanian territories transferred to
                            Poland and a gradual transition to Polonization and Polish domination.
