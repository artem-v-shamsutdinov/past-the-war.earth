                            As the wars rage and the Middle East is on the verge of a wider
                            conflict there is hope for peace. Now more than ever it is time
                            to pull for it.

                        <h2>Sudan</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the next four months, <a
                               href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/sudan/uaes-secret-war-sudan">two
                                and a half million Sudanese could die of hunger-related
                                causes</a>. Urgent action to stop the war is needed NOW!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was subjected to a drone strike
                            yesterday. Now the Swiss-brokered peace talks are at a risk of
                            failure. But stopping the war is possible. The general dynamics of
                            the situation in the region look favorable. The leadership of the
                            UAE talked with the army leadership of Sudan. Ethiopia's leadership
                            brokered the call. This is a very promising development given that
                            Ethiopia is Sudan's long-time political and military rival and the
                            UAE previously took an open-market stance on its arms sales. These
                            could be early signs of a re-arrangement of regional ties in North
                            East Africa and the Middle East. Once the external forces of the
                            war in Sudan come to an agreement the chances for peace in the
                            country will increase greatly.

                        <h2>Gaza</h2>
                        <p>
                            The situation of the civilian population of Gaza is dire, little aid
                            is making it in. Urgent action must be taken to allow increased
                            flow of food, medicine, and basic necessities into the sector.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The peace talks stalled. As Israel special forces continue to
                            assassinate Hamas leadership in an unwavering resolve to prevent any
                            future Hamas terror attack, Iran is being drawn into the conflict.
                            Turkey is also threatening intervention. Israeli leadership is set
                            on achieving total victory in Gaza but there is also a great
                            international push to achieve peace. Iran has been very wise in its
                            responses to Israeli attacks so far and there certainly is hope that
                            it will yet again demonstrate such wisdom now. The fact that Turkey
                            is threatening military action and blocking NATO aid to Israel is
                            putting additional pressure on Israel to allow to improve
                            the humanitarian situation in Gaza and initiate a ceasefire.

                        <p>
                            RAF continues to push the front line and the potential shelling and
                            drone attacks away from the city Donetsk,
                            inflicting heavy losses on AFU with its outweighing arsenal and
                            might. In turn AFU is trying to keep as much of its internationally
                            recognized but now disputed territory as possible and reports
                            inflicting heavy losses on RAF. At the same time, both sides have
                            been slowly moving their peace-making positions closer to a solution
                            that would be acceptable to the collective West and the RF.
                        </p>
                        <h2>One long-term solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            In all three conflicts, the civilian population continues to suffer
                            greatly. Progress appears to be blocked, in part due to the world
                            waiting for
                            the resolution of the political future of the USA, the center of the
                            present global economic and security systems. It is difficult to
                            make peace deals before knowing what the future position of the most
                            influential region of the world will be. Difficult but not
                            impossible.

                        <h3>Updated 8/9/2024: Inter-regional balance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Now is the time to realize that the best path toward achieving
                            stability is increased regional integration and strengthening of ALL
                            regional blocks. Despite the common belief that any regional
                            hegemon will naturally cause conflicts in the rest of the world,
                            strengthening the positions of all (internally co-latterally united)
                            parts of the world will lead to a
                            new balance where no one region can significantly destabilize any
                            other one. It is an achievable scenario and is in the best
                            interests of the world populations at large, the national elites,
                            and the international economic elites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now is the time to realize that the best path toward achieving stability
                            is increased regional integration and strengthening of ALL regional

                            naturally cause conflicts in the rest of the world. Now more than ever
                            we are closer to building regional blocks that are co-laterally united,
                            without hegemony of any of their constituent parts. Strengthening the
                            positions of all internally co-laterally united parts of the world will
                            lead to a new balance of forces, where no one region can significantly
                            destabilize any other one. It is an achievable scenario and is in the
                            best interests of the world populations at large, the national elites,
                            and the international economic elites.
                        </p>
                        <h3>It is possible</h3>
                        <p>
                            It may appear that unifying regions like Africa is an impossible
                            task but one must keep in mind that the upcoming technological
                            developments will have a profound impact on our ability to build
                            transportation links, agricultural capacity, and industrial
                            infrastructure. Of course, it will take much time for African nations
                            to unify but regional integration with strong continental
                            transportation networks will become a reality within several
                            decades. And to separate Africa from the Middle East is to split
                            sub-Saharan Africa away. Thus integration of the Arab peninsula
                            with North East Africa is the way forward. A way that has long term
                            prospects for inter-regional and eventually global conflict
                            reduction and stability.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Possible NOW</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the Red Sea and North East Africa region there is a
                            kindling possibility of regional stability through greater
                            integration of all of their countries, starting immediately
                            after the resolution of the war in Sudan. The Middle East as a whole
                            is now painfully going through reduction of external
                            influence. The real risks of a regional escalation are leading to a
                            realization of the need to keep peace despite any external drivers
                            or internal divisions. Given the developments before the Gaza war,
                            immediately after establishment of peace in Gaza greater regional
                            integration in the Middle East is the way forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fate of Ukraine is now geographically set to being the
                            borderlands between two regional blocks. Now is the time to focus
                            on securing peace in the country, a peace that would be acceptable
                            and even beneficial to both the West and the East.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Updated 8/9/2024: Starting combat non-lethality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Outside of the EU-CIS conflict in the North we are seeing unprecedented cross-regional
                            cooperation. This is an excellent development, particularly for limiting
                            future conflicts. It, combined with the steadily emerging, ubiquitous
                            regional unity will help to pull us towards limiting combat lethality to
                            the greatest possible extent. The now observed increased cooperation
                            within and across regional blocks enables us to shape how our future
                            conflicts will be led. Now is the perfect opportunity to begin laying
                            the foundation of future rules of engagement, at the highest and widest
                            level possible. We are quickly approaching a
                            version of our world in which autonomous swarms of drones begin to
                            dominate the battlefield. Such a scenario is no far away from
                            already envisioned enslavement of humanity, and is further
                            enabled by the upcoming robotization of mining, logistics and
                            manufacturing. Now is the time to really consider non-lethal combat
                            as the way forward (if we aren't capable of achieving world peace
                            any time soon).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is now becoming apparent that no matter the perspective or the
                            expectation of future developments we are now at a cornerstone
                            moment in the history of our world. Now is time to set the framework
                            for limiting future conflicts, between regions and between countries
                            within those regions. Lets get it done through achieving peace, now!
