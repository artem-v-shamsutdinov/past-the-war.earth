                            Ukraine is entering winter with Kyiv and Kharkiv now in mean average negative temperatures.
                            If Russia chooses to accelerate its likely plans the country will be defactor in diesel
                            generator mode placing the population at high risk. Now, before the customary Russian
                            winter offensive is the time to act and save the Ukrainian people from cold and hunger in
                            the best case or the being under direct fire and the beginning of the partitioning of the
                            Ukrainian state between The East and The West in the worst. Let's get to an
                            uneasy ceasefire in the now irreversible territorial realities before it's too late!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Purely on logical grounds it's becoming clear to me that despite the common belief Russia is
                            not under an existential threat because the two remaining European power centers share the
                            North Atlantic which has largely closed loop circulation if the Canary route is properly
                            managed. Russia has long been in possession of a long range (and I assume still undetectable
                            and unpreventable or at least numerous enough for that to not matter) nuclear warhead
                            torpedoes that can checkmate NATO and any time without surface irradiation or placing the
                            world at large into the nuclear winter even with just one central denotation. NATO in turn
                            has no symmetrical response because Russia is a land power. Thus, I assume that Russia
                            finally committed to the role of security guarantor for East Europe a year before the
                            invasion (with final power center coordination sign off in mid-June of 2021). My.
                            assumptions are that NATOs efforts of arming Ukraine did succeed in showing utter
                            incompetence of degenerate, feudal military leadership of the Russian Federation but
                            strategically they were misinformed and misguided. It appears that is in the interests of
                            the two ultimate world security guarantors to limit (largely unsovereign and monetarily
                            colonized) Europe to its Western half and the dream of Unified Europe is not possible under
                            the East-West scenario (nor is it entirely possible in the North-South scenario with Russia
                            being the necessary gateway under both, with hard Eural partition being highly unlikely).
                            Some luft is certainly present and as always we the humans are in charge of our own destiny,
                            but it's in no one's best interests to have an immediate land confrontation between the East
                            and the West. Hence, I must assume that no direction of "the thin bridge" laid in this such
                            scenario would be acceptable to the true powers - being on the verge of nuclear fusion power
                            we have no right to an escalation of direct hostilities - in cosmic terms we are but one
                            fledgling civilization in a 3 dimensional higher risks world but may God forbid a demise of
                            the small and primitive hearth of humanity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With that being stated the likely outcomes of this war are either slow conversion of Ukraine
                            into a no-mans land with steady absorption into the neo-feudal Russian state (with Lviv
                            seeded to Poland) or an uneasy peace with Ukraine being committed to a true neutral state,
                            with no hint of EU (and thus implied eventual NATO) membership. I must also reiterate that
                            I'm a former Soviet citizen who (having a historical perspective) considers the war in
                            Ukraine (among other things) a civil war between two peoples of common culture and origin.
                            It is this conflict that motivated me to really start thinking about how to end human losses
                            in War. Over the course of this series of articles I will examine the historical,
                            geo-political and economic causes of this war and will attempt to come up with a logical
                            explanation for why this war should end at the earliest possible moment. To start with I'm
                            proposing a general vision of how conflicts can be solved in the future, without (intended)
                            loss of life and limb:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is highly likely that for at least tens of thousands of years (certainly ever since
                            humans organized into groups large enough and had weapons) humanity experienced war on some
                            level. And certainly for tens of millions of years mammal males (due to their general
                            advantage in physical size, strength and stamina) have been protectors of their family
                            groups. There is a saying that "war is part of the human condition". Perhaps it's based on
                            the fact that male aggression must have an outlet and channeling it into armed conflicts is
                            a natural expression of competing economic (and certainly geo-political) systems. My
                            argument is that War can be controlled to virtually eliminate loss of life and limb and that
                            its current deadly state "is part of the still Primitive and Uncivilized human condition".
                        </p>
                        <h2>Limiting war</h2>
                        <p>
                            It is known that for at least thousands of years we have been thinking of how to reduce the
                            human losses caused by war. A little while ago I was talking to a veteran about this
                            problem and he brought up an interesting fact. In ancient Greece the Olympic Games (2,800
                            years ago) were (at least in part) instituted to reduce armed conflict. And even before
                            that there was a practice of champion duels to decide the outcome of conflicts without
                            risking the life and limb of all able men.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, if we've been thinking about how to reduce the human losses of war for that long, why
                            haven't we yet come up with a system that would accomplish minimal losses or no losses at
                            all?  Why is deadly war continuing into modernity?  Well the severity of the wars in the
                            modern world depends on their scale and the civilizational advancement of the parties
                            involved.  For example, for a while now (as I have recently confirmed when talking to a guy
                            from Nepal) the two of the three oldest continuous civilizations or Earth (China and India)
                            have been involved in border conflicts (with regular armed forces) where the fighting is
                            done with bare knuckles.  Certainly this isn't warfare for total domination but if these
                            culturally advanced civilizations are able to minimize the level of violence in their
                            conflicts, can't we all do better as well?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            An immediate response is that to a certain degree we (all) already have. Nuclear warfare is
                            taboo in the modern world simply because of assured mutual destruction - while still
                            under-civilized we are reasonable enough to realize that there is no point in resolving our
                            conflicts in a deadly way if there is no-one left to enjoy a victory. But complete
                            annihilation of civilization isn't the only reason why we don't use certain weapons. Since
                            the end of World War I we've also outlawed usage of chemical weapons on the battlefield and
                            certainly haven't used them in the currently ongoing Ukrainian war or the other regional
                            conflicts it led to. Biological weapons haven't been used in any war (that I'm aware of)
                            and I'm full of hope that the same will go for genetics based weapons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, when the stakes are high we limit the scale of the fighting as well. The Ukrainian war
                            is a battlefield of many levels - it's an old European unification conflict, a conflict
                            between "America the Empire" and "China the Empire", a national identity conflict between
                            the former Soviet people and an East vs West conflict. Yet Russia isn't going "all in" (at
                            least at this point) with another mass mobilization for a total victory and Ukraine isn't
                            involved in any large scale attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation. This war is
                            dominated by (often long range) artillery exchanges and not divisions of infantry making
                            sacrificial territorial gains. And neither are China or the United States sending troops or
                            cutting edge or strategic weapons and the war hasn't spread to the oceans. Even in the
                            Black Sea there haven't been any incidents between NATO and Russian navy ships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, if we are capable of limiting war, what prevents us from reducing conflicts to
                            non-lethal exchanges only (which are already taking place in cyber and other dimensions)?
                            To understand this I'm going to examine the underlying reasons for warfare that haven't
                            changed since it started and go back in history to see how the dynamics of these reasons
                            evolved overtime, in order to attempt a projection of desirable conditions into the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are many causes why that is the case but these 3 dominate - governance, resources and
                            ideology. And while the level and complexity of our governance structures has changed, the
                            types and quantities of resources have too and so have the ideologies - these three factors
                            always overwide everything else when it comes to the causes of war  No given war (certainly
                            no modern war) would start if the decision to start it wasn't made, if there was nothing to
                            fight over and if the fighting parties were in perfect harmony.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            The beginning
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            We don't know exactly how war started but there is archeological evidence of a possible
                            battle taking place over 13,000 years ago at Jebel Sahaba in Sudan. It is impossible to
                            determine what would cause a battle at that time but given the 3 dominating factors it is
                            possible to hypothesise on what led to it. Certainly the two warring groups weren't
                            governed by a strong and unified group of elders or a dominating chief and neither was there
                            enough diplomacy to prevent a war. And life was much more harsh and violent then so
                            tensions could flare up in a clan or a group. Yet, kin might kick and scream but usually
                            won't fight to the death, thus these were likely two separate groups of peoples. This most
                            probably wouldn't be their first encounter but a result of long term encroachment on each
                            other's persons or resources that first led to isolated acts of violence and finally would
                            flare up into a war. So it's impossible to determine if the leading cause (besides lack of
                            governance advanced enough to prevent war) was resource competition or an ideological
                            problem. But I tend to think such a war would start due to a general lack of high moral
                            standards (biblical for the cultures where that applies or advanced cultural or just plain
                            humane) at that point in human history - physical violence against individuals of foreign
                            groups was likely much more common then and the main problem was probably the general
                            ideology of violence.

                            The first battle in written history took place in Mesopotamia 4,700 years ago between the
                            forces of neighboring Sumer and Elam. The world of these nations was much different than
                            before. Agriculture caused people to settle down and lead much larger populations. Towns
                            and cities appeared, each city with its own God and ideology. Frequent border warfare
                            caused rapid technological advancement in the implements of war with various weapons and
                            warrior specialization. First small groups of professional soldiers appeared and we began
                            to use metal (in small quantities af first) to equip them. There was more to fight over,
                            there was no more common naturalistic ideology and much stronger competing governments lead
                            their societies with widely differing goals and beliefs. These were still very early days
                            of our (collective) civilization with isolated pockets of higher density settlements in
                            places with the best natural conditions for cultures to flourish, thousands of years passed
                            since the first attempts at agriculture and settlements but society was still very much
                            surrounded by wilderness and that was still the driving force behind their beliefs but the
                            days of theocratic rule have passed and complex polytheistic mythologies have evolved. But
                            everyone was sent to dark underground caverns after death, irrespective of how they behaved
                            in life. The two warring states were no longer in primitive socio-economic conditions but
                            the kingships were still very primitive with slavery used for debtors, criminals and
                            enemies. War likely became a constant state of affairs between the surrounding city states
                            at that point. As they have been for thousands of years before then, large settlements were
                            already walled but the armies were (and would be for most states) seasonal, tied to crop
                            cultivation for the bulk of the year.

                            The first battle to be recorded in detail took place 4,500 years ago in Egypt, which being
                            focused on monument construction (possibly by a demonstration of control and order by a
                            higher protectorate to insure no interference in independent development of geographically
                            well balanced Mesopotamia that continued the clean path laid in Anatolia) the geographically
                            isolated Egypt was always backwards in military technology and limited in its range (as it
                            also was to the potential invaders). Its navy was focused on management of the main internal
                            waterway and effectively achieved all of the pax functions of the modern US fleets. This the
                            frontier for expansion was reached effectively and early enough for a relatively peaceful
                            agrarian society to develop. Central governance and management of resources ensued thus
                            largely reducing armed conflict to rebellions and common defence efforts (with ideology
                            likely being fixed on a commonly impressed upon and naturally misunderstood path to direct
                            solar fusion on a massive scale).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first professional army arrived with the Akkadian empire (also the first known empire)
                            that conquered most of the city states in Mesopotamia about 4,300 years ago. As empires
                            tend to, it used conquest as the means of existence but went into decline after the ruler
                            that created it died. While the dynasties existed by then it was still possible for a
                            commoner to rise up to the very top and build an empire but a pedigree of nobility and
                            rule by divine decree were already desired societal traits. Having attained a high status
                            at times kings were worshiped as gods. Conquest was glorified and it appears that no
                            particular justification was required to subjugate your neighbors as long as you had
                            sufficient force to do so. Subsequent rebellions of the conquered were frequent (signifying
                            that the rule of the conquerors was not desired) and were put down brutally. Entire cities
                            were destroyed and human losses were enormous - it appears that no attempts were made to be
                            humane. Though gods of ancient conquered cities were respected. Building an empire paid
                            off materially with the empire having grown rich off the spoils of war so it is possible
                            that enrichment was openly and admittedly the main reason to start wars. Ideology of
                            exercising power over your neighbors was in its raw, unjustified form - while city states
                            may still have been dominated by priestly orders and agreeable kings the empire was ruled by
                            an iron fist.

                            At the time of the Bronze age collapse a different war was fought. Likely driven by
                            unfavorable climatic change and the resulting hunger the relatively primitive European
                            mercenaries (reportedly employed in at least Egypt) raided the entire Mediterranean side of
                            the ancient world into complete technological and cultural collapse. With no central
                            governance this was an uncontrollable war for material (resource) survival and only
                            successfully withstood by Egypt with its superior central command, organization and numbers.
                            The raiders were clearly motivated by survival and no ideology was present in their actions.

                        <p>
                            The Assyrian empire (back in Mesopotamia) was the first lasting empire (meaning a
                            government that persists as long as it conquers) that institutionalized war. Having
                            survived the Bronze Age collapse more or less unscaved the Assyrian warrior kings built an
                            enormous empire starting from about 3,300 years ago for about 600 years. They
                            institutionalized brutal warfare and constantly glorified their brutality against enemies.
                            Already there was an ideology of total global domination - kings were expected to conquer
                            their "inferior" neighbors by almost any means possible until the empire covered the world.
                            Of course in reality there was plenty of diplomacy with near sized rivals until those could
                            be conquered. Assyrians did manage to conquer all of the "civilized world" around them,
                            shortly before collapsing. It was the Assyrians that practiced transplantation of entire
                            nations to other locations in order to subjugate them. They were feared and hated by all of
                            their conquered subject peoples and were happily forgotten after their demise. Certainly
                            there was still an element of conquer or be conquered present in this time period but the
                            core driver was likely the ideology of being superior and prestigious. Of course enrichment
                            through conquest played a role but it no longer the official (natural) ideology. And while
                            the Assyrians would negotiate when they had to, there was no means of stopping their
                            conquest by diplomatic means. As empires do, it kept on conquering until it reached its
                            natural boundaries...

                            In the next installment I will take a look at the other two (though geographically of
                            limited influence, to differing degrees) starting points of civilization on Earth, though
                            possibly impacted by (the logically and natural in a 3 dimensional multi party setting)
                            concessions to lesser but (and with that assumption, in India's case even infantile thus
                            likely very) closely related "cosmic relatives" - India and China (this is part of genesis
                            myths and is believed in these countries). I will then continue with the evolution of the
                            causes of war to the middle ages before pausing before the European East/West conflict.
                            <b>Update February 7th, 2024</b> Unfortunately I must postpone the continuation of my
                            historical research until a later time.

                            Now I take the earliest opportunity to let a wider
                            range of audience know that it is time to prepare a peaceful resolution, before the now
                            disillusioned Russian forces decide to take the next 4 Oblast' and effectively end Ukrainian
                            independence (with already hinted subsequent taking of Kiev if EU persists in its
                            expansionary strategy) - we have some time before the ground is frozen solid for the winter
                            offensive, a month before the Orthodox Christmas and even more before the Winter Holidays
                            are over in the former Soviet Union. We may not be able to cause a cease fire but (despite
                            my Soviet upbringing of merely existing in the System) our independently made choices may
                            cause the true powers to kick off the right chains of events - I urge you to remember that
                            it's human life that matters most to us! Let us remember that the destabilizing Ukraine war
                            spread south through the East - West dividing zone and hit in the now largely ignored
                            birthplace of war - Sudan. The humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan is an order of magnitude
                            larger and will be immediately affected if the open hostilities between the influencing
                            powers cease. And the relaxation in the security climate in the intermediately located
                            middle East will allow the Palestinian people to rebuild with then freely flowing aid. Let's
                            get a ceasefire in Ukraine by mid April 2024!

                            I would like to end with the oldest known human song and a vision for the non-lethal, non
                            mangling fusion of war to be accomplished in a century (by 2128 to have a specific and
                            measurable goal) that the veteran I was talking to did not correct:

                            A year and a half ago I was arguing with my best childhood friend that the Ukrainan conflict
                            should be resolved by a street match between Klitchko and Valuev on the streets of Kyiv.
                            Probably because of that such an idea came to me ...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Imagine a field with young men on both sides in boxing gear, honor bound to not make any
                            blows below the belt and to let the fallen opponent be carried away by a caring battle nurse
                            if they didn't stand in 10 seconds. Of course to control the heat of battle sergeants would
                            be leading the young men, equipped with rubberized sticks meant to knock sense into helmets
                            with too much fire in them. And before the possible battle imagine champions on horseback
                            letting the heavens decide who's right in a closely watched dance with blunted lances and
                            swords meant to strike the shining armor. Who said we can't get this done!
