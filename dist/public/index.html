                    If Japan's civilization had to be described by one visualisation, the famous
                    picture of the huge wave over Mount Fuji would probably work best. Thus, it
                    could be argued that it has attained its unparalleled cultural refinement (which
                    is likely our best hope for long term survival in the cosmic world) and military
                    might (necessary to maintain our independence) through the natural facts of its
                    existence. Japan is once again prioritising its defense.

                  Korea's location between China, Russia and Japan forces it to balance between
                  greater forces. In the face of changing generational preferences North Korea is
                  changing its peninsular policy, while South Korea is increasing its regional
                  influence, expressing willingness to work with "not like minded" states and is
                  proactively seeking a renewal of the international order.

                    The world was much easier to manage when there were two poles of
                    influence. Modern day
                    Commonwealth of Independent States is largely an agglomeration of
                    neo-feudal states without a
                    global idea. The natural "Global North/South" split will more
                    equally take into account
                    interests of all sovereignties, but it will take time to arrive at
                    such a configuration.

                  Eurasia's history is marked by the freeing influence of the West and the
                  willful approach of the
                  East. It stands as the gateway between these two ways of thinking and
                  two ways of life. The Russian
                  Federation is the biggest and most influential state of this formation.
                  It has a relatively low
                  population and very vast territory. Combined with the northern climate
                  this led to the development
                  of wait-and-see progress bursts, aggressively defensive martial culture
                  (with a necessity to
                  centralize) and a mobilization economy. Being considered a Western
                  country in the East and an
                  Eastern country in the West, Russia offers a way of thinking that blends
                  both perspectives.

                  The reasoning for invading Iraq has wider multifaceted
                  regional basis and goes deeper than the misguided effort to
                  remove a security threat or the blatant pursuit of an
                  opportunistic war to solidify hegemony.

                  The Western Civilization starts with Greek democracy of the
                  privileged many, moves to the republic of the powerful few
                  and goes to the more free vassage of the chosen noble. The
                  non-violent and universal Christianity played a critical
                  role in moderating the feudal rights and its subsequent
                  relaxation added a resource perspective to subsequent
                  Western expansion.

                  AUKUS is a security partnership between the USA, UK and
                  Australia. The three constituent countries of AUKUS
                  descended from Great Britain, which developed the fastest
                  among the Western nations. Its geography acted as both a
                  protective barrier and as an incentive to have a more
                  moderated, trade oriented outlook on warfare.

                <p>
                  From the early beginnings of its history China has
                  considered itself the middle land that exists in the midst
                  of relatively more barbarian surroundings. Until the Western
                  Imperial expansion of the 19th century terms "the Middle
                  Kingdom" and then the more encompassing "All under Heaven"
                  were common. For the bulk of the history of our
                  civilizations it has been the biggest economic and trade
                  force on the planet. In the post-Imperial age the slogan
                  "Striving for Unity" is helping the Chinese people look past
                  their differences and work towards social harmony. At the
                  same time this concept is used to proactively oppose the
                  remaining Western influence over the Chinese state and its
                  territories, including the controversially debated Taiwan.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Besides unity the modern day Chinese culture is very much
                  about prosperity. China is not interested in conquering its
                  surroundings and would rather enjoy economic leadership
                  achieved through war-preempting means.

                  There are 5 forces that play a decisive role in the
                  resolution of the Ukraine -> Sudan -> Gaza conflict chain.
                  They are AUKUS, Russian Federation, China, India and Japan
                  (in the order of relevance). The two civilizational
                  countries that have the most influence in resolution of the
                  on-going conflicts are India and China. Providing the Causes
                  of War of these countries pave the path towards an as soon
                  as possible, peaceful resolution of these conflicts, which
                  has to do with realizing that we are on the verge of

                  Current wars in Sudan, Gaza and Ukraine are interlinked and
                  resolving the most global of these conflicts will lead to
                  stabilizing, cascading effects. Lack of immediate action to
                  stop humanitarian crises will have negative cascading
                  effects for the entire planet and for the main power holders
                  in the world.

                  Ukraine is entering winter with Kyiv and Kharkiv now in mean
                  average negative temperatures. If Russia chooses to
                  accelerate its likely plans the country will be defactor in
                  diesel generator mode placing the population at high risk.
                  Now, before the customary Russian winter offensive is the
                  time to act and save the Ukrainian people from cold and
                  hunger in the best case or the being under direct fire and
                  the beginning of the partitioning of the Ukrainian state
                  between The East and The West in the worst. Let's get to an
                  uneasy ceasefire in the now irreversible territorial
                  realities before it's too late!
