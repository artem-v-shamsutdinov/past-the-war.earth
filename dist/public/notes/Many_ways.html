To be released: ?December 31st, 2025?

<br>
There will be more than one way to arrive at more than one version of NLNM. Time and effort will
have to be put in to get include all of the viable ways in the way forward and get the people (that
will eventually be working on them) to work towards the common goal (Non-Lethal, non-mutilating, no
serious injury combat).
<br>
<br>
Along with that, progress will be marching forward, the seas will gain more importance and space
will get ever closer to us. Additional development vectors will always be present in defence and
must be welcomed. Even in dry-surface conflict resolutions parallel to NLNM vectors will and perhaps
must exist. We must work to ensure that they will work in concert with NLNM warfare.
