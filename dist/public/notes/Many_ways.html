<br>
There will be more than one way to arrive at more than one version of NLNM. Time and effort will
have to be put in to include all of the viable ways in the way forward and get the people (that
will eventually be working on them) to work towards the common goal (Non-Lethal, Non-Mutilating, No
Serious Injury combat).
<br>
<br>
Along with that, progress will be marching forward, the seas will gain more importance and space
will get ever closer to us. Additional development vectors will always be present in defence and
must be welcomed. Even in dry-surface conflict resolutions parallel to NLNM vectors will and perhaps
must exist. We must work to ensure that they will work in concert with NLNM warfare.
<br>
<br>
<b>Added: 8/30/25</b>  There are always better ways for us to accomplish things and NLNM warfare is
no different. Â Some of us must necessarily be dedicated to make NLNM a real option, but (in personal
perceptive experience) there is at least one other hinted at option that feels much better, and
with passage of time and largely depending on our collective actions the understanding of better
options may become available to us.
