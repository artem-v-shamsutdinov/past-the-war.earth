UK - the leader in The Social Evolution
<br>
<br>
Goal: Combining the (by then purely) ceremonial Open Threat of Violence system ("we must truly be
the best of the best" and thus a truly inspiring example), economically efficient Veiled Threat of
Violence system and socially/politically efficient (yet to come) No Threat of Violence system.
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Self Determination: MPs accountable to the people of Britain first (over the
        crown). ??? MPs elected by councils in an open vote, with a right to recall OR a newer and
        better way to achieve bidirectional accountability control over special interests ???
    </li>
    <li>Security: Presenting No Threat of Violence instead of Open Threat of Violence to foreign
        nations</li>
    <li>Prosperity: Greatly improved trade relations with the rest of the world</li>
    <li>Positive Long Term Outlook: The respected global thought leadership, most efficient
        governance system, socially avangard economic hub</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Active External Forces: Everybody and their uncle.</li>
</ul>
