<b>Update 10/7/2024, 10/9/2024</b> Focusing on seeing (and appropriatey to NLNM if necessary awakening)
conscience and other positive characteristics that dominate over instinctual behavior in humans
(seeing relatable, good persons, or if that's too much to think about without practice, to begin
with, just seeing a human face) under stressful conditions can be a difficult and taxing task that
requires discipline and persistence. Being aware of the pull of Earth and the air you breathe may
take much sustained practice. Yet the two of them may not be enough to ensure enforcement of NLNM by
all opposing forces. NLNM combatants must also respect the time and work of many generations of
peoples who built their cultures, no matter how foreign in nature, primitive or out of touch those
cultures appear to be.
<br>
<br>
Pre and post battle rituals or customs that build the respect for these three factors may do much
good towards enforcing NLNM outcomes.
