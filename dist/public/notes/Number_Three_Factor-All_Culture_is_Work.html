<b>Update 10/7/2024</b> Focusing on conscience in humans under stressful conditions can be a difficult and taxing task that
requires discipline and persistence. Being aware of the pull of Earth and the air you breathe may
take much sustained practice. Yet the two of them may not be enough to ensure enforcement of NLNM by
all opposing forces. NLNM combatants must also respect the time and work of many generations of
peoples who built their cultures, no matter how foreign in nature, primitive or out of touch those
cultures appear to be.

<br>
Pre and post battle rituals or customs that build the respect for these three factors may do much
good for enforcing NLNM outcomes.
