The version of NLNM proposed here that many would probably subscribe to is a land-based hand-to-hand
combat system. As such it is meant to be implemented on any suitable land-based terrain on our
planet Earth. It is a combat system that is expected to eventually be used by all entites Earth with
defense responsibilities of the governmental structures.
<br>
<br>
This combat system is expected to last until there there is a planetary entity with a common defence
resposibility. There is on expectation of implementation of NLNM beyond Earth. Though given its
logically moral and practical usage integration into a wider NLNM system may also be possible.
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, by design NLNM is meant for the dry surface of Earth and the human population on its
dry surface. This is the second identified factor to implementing and maintaining NLNM - the
active realization that we constantly feel the perfect-for-us gravity of Earth and constanly
breathe its perfect-for-us air. No matter to what entity we owe our allegance to, no matter what
corner of the Earth is dear to us, it is our common Mother Planet. We all have our lesser
Motherlands, no matter how how large and federated they may or may not be, but zwe trully have the
one Mother Land.
