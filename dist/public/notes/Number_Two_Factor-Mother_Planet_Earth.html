The version of NLNM proposed here (that many would probably subscribe to) is that of a land-based,
hand-to-hand
combat system. As such it is meant to be implemented on any suitable land-based terrain on our
planet Earth. It is a combat system that is expected to eventually be used by all Earth-based
entites with
defense responsibilities of governmental structures.
<br>
<br>
This combat system is expected to last until there is a planetary entity with a common defence
resposibility. There is the expectation of implementation of NLNM beyond Earth. Though, given its
logically moral and practical usage, integration into a wider NLNM system (<b>Linked: 3/3/2025</b>) 
<a href="https://may-there-always-be-sunshine.space/notes/Age_One_map.html">may</a> also be  (<b>Linked: 2/28/2025</b>) <a

...
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, by design NLNM is meant for the dry surface of Earth and the human population on its
dry surface. This is the second identified factor of implementing and maintaining NLNM - the
active realization of constantly feeling the perfect-for-us gravity of Earth and constanly
breathing its perfect-for-us air. No matter what entity has our allegance, no matter what
corner of the Earth is dear to us, it is our common Mother Planet. We all have our lesser
Motherlands, no matter how large and federated they may or may not be, but we trully have the
one Mother Land.
