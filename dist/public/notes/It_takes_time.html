Draft: It will take time
<br>
<br>
To be released: ?November 7th, 2025?

It will take an known period of time to get to initial implementation of NLNM. It will probably
take lots more time to get it working for the entire planet, working correctly. This is a long
term, with a high degree of probability multi-generational process. But it must be done and
sustained effort must be put in. The longer people work on it and the more people get involved
the more respect the feasibility of NLNM will get.
<br>
<br>
There will be lots of other factors coming in. People have already done lots of work on the way
things are now and there are reasons for that. We (as I believe that at least some of the readers
will join the cause and stick with it) must respect the time they collectively put into
their work and not forget the real drivers that lead to all this work being done. We must respect
time, including the time people put into their work, even if at first appears to go against NLNM
principles.
