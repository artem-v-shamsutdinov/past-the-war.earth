                            The European roots of WWII are known to lie in the harsh terms of the
                            Treaty of Versailles in 1919 after the end of World War I (1914-1918),
                            in which the British-French(-Russian Triple) Entente 1904(07) defeated
                            (with Russia withdrawing in 1918 due to devastating losses) the Triple
                            Alliance (1882) of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy. After fierce

                            The Axis Powers of WWII began forming with the Rome-Berlin Axis of <a
                               href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">Fascist</a> Italy and
                            Nazi Germany in October 1936. In November 1936 the Nazi Germany signed
                            the Anti-Comintern Pact with Imperial Japan. It was followed by their
                            Pact of Steel in May 1939. In June 1940 Fascist Italy allied with Nazi
                            Germany against France and the British Empire. Signing of the Tripartite
                            Pact in September 1940 marked the Entry of Japan in the Axis.

                            The Spanish Civil War was fought from July 1936 to April 1939 between
                            the Nationalists of Spanish State, supported by the Axis, and
                            Republicans of the Second Spanish Republic supported by the Soviet Union
                            and Mexico.

                            On September 1st, 1939 the Nazi Germany invaded Poland. On September 3rd
                            the British Empire declared war on Nazi Germany. The preceding signing
                            of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on August 23rd, 1939 divided Eastern Europe
                            without a direct confrontation between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet
                            Union. On September 17th, 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Poland,
                            immediately following a cease-fire with Imperial Japan. November 1939
                            to March 1940 Soviet Union invaded Finland and annexed part of its
                            territory. In April 1940 Nazi Germany invaded Denmark. In April-June
                            1940 it invaded Norway. In May 1940 it invaded Luxembourg, Netherlands
                            and Belgium. France was attacked and defeated by the Axis in May-June of
                            1940. In June 1940 Soviet Union invaded and subsequently annexed
                            Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. In June-July 1940 it annexed parts of
                            Romania. The air and naval battle of Britain from July to October 1940
                            overlapped with the bombings of the Blitz from September 1040 to May
                            1941.

                            Following the Molotov-Ribnentrop Pact, Britain and Poland signed an
                            agreement for mutual assistance. In September 1939 the Anglo-French
                            Supreme War Council was established. In June 1941 the first
                            Inter-Allied Conference between United Kingdom, Commonwealth Dominions
                            of Canada, Australia, New Zeland and South Africa, and nine
                            governments in exile including Free France signed the London
                            Declaration against the Axis. In August 1941 the Atlantic Charter
                            was signed ensuring the support of the United Kingdom by the United
                            States. In January 1942 the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet
                            Union and China and subsequently 22 other nations signed what became
                            the United Nations Declaration pledging all of their resources against
                            the Axis.

                            In June 1940 the allied British Empire invaded Italian Libya.
                            Soon after in June 1940 Fascist Italy started attacking the British
                            colonies and protectorate surrounding the Italian East Africa. In
                            January 1941 the allied British, Indian and several African forces
                            initiated the counter offensive on Italian East Africa. Fighting in
                            East Africa took place in modern day Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia,
                            Djibouti, Kenya, and Sudan. In September 1940 the Kingdom of Egypt
                            was attacked by Fascist Italy, with Nazi Germany joining in February
                            1941. In May 1942 Allies invaded Vichy-French controlled Madagascar.
                            In November 1942 Allies invaded Vichy-French controlled North Africa
                            in modern-day Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.

                            Between December 1941 and February 1942 Imperial Japan conquered British
                            territories of modern day Malasiya fighting against Indian and other
