                            The European roots of WWII are known to lie in the harsh terms of the
                            Treaty of Versailles in 1919 after the end of World War I (1914-1918),
                            in which the British-French(-Russian Triple) Entente 1904(07) defeated
                            (with Russia withdrawing in 1918 due to devastating losses) the Triple

                            The Axis Powers of WWII began forming with the Rome-Berlin Axis of <a

                            Nazi Germany in October 1936. It was followed by their Pact of Steel in
                            May 1939. In June 1940 Fascist Italy allied with Nazi Germany against
                            France and the British Empire. Signing of the Tripartite Pact in
                            September 1940 marked the Entry of Japan in the Axis.

                            The Spanish Civil War was fought from July 1936 to April 1939 between
                            the Nationalists of Spanish State, supported by the Axis, and
                            Republicans of the Second Spanish Republic supported by the Soviet Union

                            On September 1st, 1939 the Nazi Germany invaded Poland. On September 3rd
                            the British Empire declared war on Nazi Germany. The preceding signing
                            of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on August 23rd, 1939 divided Eastern Europe
                            without a direct confrontation between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet
                            Union. On September 17th, 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Poland,
                            immediately following a cease-fire with Imperial Japan. France was
                            attacked and defeated by the Axis in May-June of 1940. The air and naval
                            battle of Britain from July to October 1940 overlapped with the bombings
                            of the Blitz from September 1040 to May 1941.

                            The African campaigns started in June 1940 in Italian Libya. In
                            September 1940 the Kingdom of Egypt was attacked by Fascist Italy, with
                            Nazi Germany joining in February 1941. In November 1942 Allies invaded
                            Vichy-French controlled North Africa in modern-day Morocco, Algeria and
                            Tunisia. In June 1940 Fascist Italy attacked the British colonies and
                            protectorate surrounding the Italian East Africa. Allied main counter
                            counterattack was initiated in January 1941. Fighting in East Africa took
                            place in modern day Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti, Kenya, and
                            Sudan. In May 1942 Allies invaded Vichy French-controlled Madagascar.

                            The Greco-Italian War took place between October 1940 and April 1941,
                            culminating in the Battle of Greece in April - June 1941. In April 1941
                            Axis invaded Yugoslavia. The Anglo-Iraqi war took place in April-May
                            1941. The Syrian-Lebanese campaign took place in July 1941. In August
                            1941 Allies invaded Iran.

                            In June 1941 the Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union and in December
                            1941 Imperial Japan attacked the United States.

                            Immediately following the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941
                            Imperial Japan invaded Thailand, started the invasion of the
                            Philippines, Hong Kong, and began invading British, USA, Australian and
                            independent pacific islands. Brunei was also invaded in December 1941.
                            Between December 1941 and February 1942 Imperial Japan conquered British
                            territories of modern day Malasiya fighting against Indian and other
                            troops of the British Empire.

                            In January 1942 Imperial Japan started the invasion of the Dutch East
                            Indies - modern day Indonesia. In January 1942 it attacked Burma,
                            defended by Indian, Chinese and African troops. Also in January 1942 it
                            attacked New Guinea and in July 1942 the Territory of Papua. British
                            Singapore Surrendered to Imperial Japan in February 1942. In February
                            1942 Imperial Japan started air raids on Australia. Also in February it
                            occupied Portuguese Timor. In March 1942 Imperial Japan started the
                            Indian Ocean raid and occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In 1944 it
                            attempted to occupy Manipur.
