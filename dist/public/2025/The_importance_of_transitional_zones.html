                        <p>
                            There is a saying in India - we would have no problems with China if
                            Tibet was independent. The largest mountain range on the planet is between
                            the two countries, <b>Fixed: 1/18/2025</b> Nepal providess some distance between the
                            most heavily populated Uttar Pradesh & Bihar, while Butan separates China from northern West
                            Bengal & western Assam, but that has not sufficiently insulated the two
                            countries from each other, pertaining to security. There is a clear need
                            for a large, contiguous land mass between the two regions with sufficiently
                            different interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of the current armed conflicts are taking place in current
                            "transitional zones". Sudan is a region that separates the Middle East
                            and East Africa (among others). Israel (with Gaza being a nested "transitional
                            zone") and by extension Jordan separates Egypt from The Kingdom of Saudi
                            Arabia and, as a group, the whole of the Arabian Peninsula to the southeast; and from Lebanon+Syria and
                            (by extension) now increasingly so from Turkey to the north. Ukraine separates the European Union from the
                            Russian Federation and by extension the Commonwealth of Independent
                            States.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are also two less known transitional zones of Democratic Republic
                            of Congo, which separates the influence zones of Nigeria (West Africa),
                            South Africa (of the wider Southern Africa) and Uganda & Kenya (of East
                            Africa); and <b>Fixed: 1/18/2025</b> Myanmar (Burma) which is the flat land (relative to the Himalayas) transitional zone
                            between India, China and the rest of South East Asia to which it belongs. Both of these zones have very high, long term
                            strategic importance for the people of the surrounding subcontinents. Both also have lesser known and understood, long
                            term armed conflicts that are very sensitive in their nature and involve
                            a wide array of interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Transitional zones can and as we are currently experiencing do become
                            war zones. But, in times of peace, as a result of that trade and communication,
                            they can be transportation hubs and related technology hubs (living in Denver that is clearly apparent to me). They have the potential
                            to unite the regions at their edges or at least to moderate differences
                            between them. Out of all of these regions the one with the most
                            potential for improving the wider region around it is DRC, and with
                            coming (though possibly regionally delayed) technological paradigm shifts of
                            nuclear fusion (clean, limitless, cheap energy) and robotization
                            (productivity improvements, especially in hard to work in areas) it has
                            the potential of finally unifying all of Sub-Saharan Africa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the world at large, the most important wider region zone is the
                            Middle East, which is in the center of most of the Old World and, by
                            extension of Iranian influence in Afghanistan, also connects East Asia.
                            In terms of threats to global security the wider region of CIS has the
                            most importance as it separates EU and PRC, connects to the Middle East
                            (West Asia) and by extension of South Asian influence into Afghanistan
                            connects to South Asia and its influence hub of India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2025 the three most known of these conflicts will almost definitely
                            end and the shift in global security focus may cause at least an easing
                            in the other two mentioned here. Of all of these, the hardest to achieve
                            long-term resolution in, is the conflict in Ukraine. The two adjacent
                            macro regions are both de-facto claiming the region as their own and this is
                            resulting in the stalling of the peace (or at least the ceasefire)
                            process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a while now the scenario of partionioning of Ukraine has been
                            discussed and even predicted, with Western Ukraine joining the EU and
                            the bulk of the country joining CIS. However given the massive loss of
                            life in the conflict this scenario does not appear to be a stable one in
                            the long term. The alternative scenario of setting up a sizable
                            contingent transitional zone of neo-Grand Duchy of Lithuania also does
                            not appear to be feasible with modern Lithuania being in EU and NATO and
                            Belarus being in the Union state with RF.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On top of that, from a historical perspective such a formation would be
                            strong enough to compete for influence with both the EU and the CIS and
                            would eventually likely join one of the two. If it joins the EU (as
                            seems more likely than the other scenario) then it would alter the
                            global balance of forces and potentially lead to disintegration of CIS
                            and <b>Fixed: 1/18/2025</b> (de-facto) political division of the region (if not its member states) between Europe and East Asia. Certainly as a
                            former Soviet citizen I adamantly oppose such a scenario (and on a basic
                            level support the reunification of the USSR, though as mentioned above
                            that has become all but impossible to achieve peacefully, with stability in the long term).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hence, keeping in mind the importance of transitional zones in
                            preventing armed conflicts and possibly hostilities, the solution of a
                            fully neutral Ukraine that respects the status of Russian culture and
                            language, while being open to EU influence appears to be a superior
                            option to the option of its partitioning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, likely through divine providence, the argument stated here <a
                               href="../2024/Time_to_act_is_now.html">nearly a year ago</a> still
                            appears to hold. A Ukraine that forbids any Nazi tendencies (even if
                            they are superficial in nature), is willing to integrate economically
                            into CIS (due to its geographical protrusion into the CIS zone of
                            influence), more so than with EU, may be the best option out of the armed
                            conflict. Yet at the same time, just as Switzerland, Ukraine has the
                            right to be properly armed and prepared to repel invasion from any side.
                            May God help the involved parties in the most expedient resolution of
                            this most deadly armed conflict.
