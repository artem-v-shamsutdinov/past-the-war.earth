                            Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine armed conflicts update
                        </h2>
                        <h3>Sudan</h3>
                        <p>
                            RSF has lost ground but Army's outright victory is unsure. The number of
                            mostly independent milicias is growing, the majority loosely aligned
                            with the Army. The conflict-driving external interests have rearranged
                            but there are no open signs of an agreement. An AU lead UN peacekeeping
                            mission does not appear to be possible. Humanitarian aid is beginning to
                            arrive in the country but its continuous, large-scale supply is
                            uncertain. If the situation does not drastically improve in the coming
                            months, a peacekeeping intervention by a major power may be the best
                            option for stopping the conflict.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Gaza</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hamas is under heavy pressure and is more willing to negotiate, now
                            forming a coalition with its prior rival Fatah. Israel's government is
                            also under heavy pressure and accusations pushing it to come to an
                            agreement. Humanitarian aid flow to the Gaza strip is intermittent and
                            lacks sufficient protection from looting and attacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the wider region the ceasefire in Lebanon is under question. As a
                            result of the shift in the balance of forces, armed conflict in Syria
                            has been re-activated. A full blown conflict between Iran and Israel has
                            been averted and new security ties in the region and beyond have been
                            and are continuing to be established.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Ukraine</h3>
                        <p>
                            RF political leadership exhibited a positive opinion of the upcoming
                            USA administration and Ukraine leadership's recently proposed
                            territorially adjusted peace. There is little overlap in the stated
                            positions of the two warring parties but general signs of progress
                            towards a ceasefire agreement exist.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Revitalized Hope</h3>
                        <p>
                            Change of USA administration is leading to re-adjustment of priorities
                            across the globe. Whether by sufficient resolution of differences,
                            re-arrangement of zones of influence, re-asserted control, war fatigue
                            or all of the above, there is hope for peace to be achieved sooner
                            rather than later.

                            The World continues to be divided, between "East" and "West", between
                            "North" and "South". It is further sub-divided into regions and
                            countries within those regions. Our regions are different geographically
                            and climatically and over our history naturally diverted culturally and
                            civilizationally. Each society and related group of societies took a
                            different developmental path and learned different collective lessons at
                            different times. Over time and distance we developed different ways of
                            thinking and different belief systems. But despite all our divisions and
                            differences we must remember that all of us are and always have been
                            human. And while our collective thinking progresses, we all have been
                            human, created in the image of God, long before any of our civilizations
                            started their histories.

                            all levels and stages of implementation. The first in order of
                            identification and importance factor to NLNM is seeing humans in the
                            opponent, over/overriding the velocity, direction and number of their
                            vectors of development, or any other factors. Enforcing this factor
                            needs to start with higher command to maintain strategic direction and
                            discipline.

                            Maintaining the primacy of the "we are all human" factor will prevent
                            any dehumanization of opponents. By agreeing that our opponents are
                            human we are agreeing to treat them humanely, including treating them
                            humanely in war. To accomplish this the realization of our common
                            humanity must be proactive until it becomes second nature. Whether
                            driven by the regulations or by the culture, humanization of the
                            opponent is to be the ubiquitous norm.

1. Impartial digest of 3 most deadly and mutilating armed conflicts in the world.
<br>
<br>
2. <b>Update 9/26/2024</b> NLNM is a system of controlled violence in war that prevents lethality,
mutilation and serious injury. There are key factors that allow to achieve and maintain this system.
These factors can be used on all levels and stages of implementation. The first in order of
identification and importance factor to NLNM is seeing human in the opponent, over/overriding the
velocity, direction and number of
their vectors of development, or any other factors. Enforcing this factor needs to start with higher
command to maintain strategic direction and discipline.
