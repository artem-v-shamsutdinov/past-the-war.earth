Ideology
<br>
<br>
For a long time we've known what it means to be a Westerner or an Easterner and we understand what it means to be a Northerner or a Southerner. The age of empires has taught us what it means to be an Anarchist, a Monarchist, a Fascist or a Communist.  All of those ideologies are still present in some form today, often peacefully coexisting in Western democracies.  In the new-colonial age we've re-learned that creed, religion, "race" or ethnicity can all peacefully co-exist in any given national culture.  But despite those gains the world is once again engulfed in violence with previous rules for peace no longer being respected.  Perhaps it is time to start realizing what it means to be an African, an East Asian, a Eurasian, a European, a Middle Eastern, a North American, a South American, a South Asian, a South-East Asian.  Could that get us further toward realizing that we are in fact all of the same race, same underlying tradition and share the same land?
