As the wars rage and the Middle East is on the verge of a wider conflict there is some hope for peace.
Sudan

General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was subjected to a drone strike yesterday.  Now the Swiss-brokered peace talks are at a risk of failure. But the general dynamics of the situation in the region look favorable. The leadership of the UAE talked with the army leadership of Sudan.  Ethiopia's leadership brokered the call.  This is a very promising development given that Ethiopia is Sudan's long-time political and military rival and the UAE previously had an open-market stance in its arms sales.  These could be early signs of a re-arrangement of regional ties in North East Africa and the Middle East.  Once the external forces of the war in Sudan come to an agreement the chances for peace in the country will increase greatly.
Gaza
The peace talks stalled. As Israel continues to assassinate Hamas leadership Iran is being drawn into the conflict.  Turkey is also threatening intervention.  Israeli leadership is set on achieving total victory in Gaza but there is also a great international push to achieve peace. Iran has been very wise in its responses to Israeli attacks so far and there certainly is hope that it will yet again demonstrate such wisdom now.
Ukraine
RAF continues to push the front line away from Donetsk, inflicting heavy losses on AFU, which in turn reports inflicting heavy losses on RAF.  At the same time, both sides have been slowly moving their peace-making positions closer to a solution that would be acceptable to the collective West and the RF.  

In all three conflicts, the civilian population continues to suffer greatly.  But progress is blocked - the world is waiting for the resolution of the political future of the USA.  This reduces the likelihood of a peaceful resolution of any of these conflicts before it is known what the position of the most influential region of the world will be.
Yet now is the time to begin realizing that the best path toward achieving stability is increased regional integration and strengthening of regional blocks.  Despite the common belief that any regional hegemon will naturally cause conflicts in the rest of the world, strengthening the positions of all parts of the world will lead to a new balance where no one region can significantly destabilize any other one.
It may appear that unifying regions like Africa is an impossible task but one must keep in mind that the upcoming technological developments will have a profound impact on our ability to build transportation links, agricultural capacity, and industrial infrastructure.  Of course, it will take time and to separate Africa from the Middle East is to split sub-Saharan Africa away but we must keep in mind that the course for regional unification is likely the surest way to limit hostilities going forward.
In the Red Sea and North East Africa region, there is a kindling possibility of regional stability through greater integration of all of its member countries.  The Middle East as a whole is now painfully going through the process of reduction in external influence.  The real risks of a regional escalation are leading to a realization of the need to keep peace despite any external drivers or internal divisions.
The fate of Ukraine has been geographically set to be the borderlands between two regional blocks.  Now is the time to focus on securing peace in the country, a peace that would be acceptable and even beneficial to both the West and the East.

It is now becoming apparent that no matter the perspective or the expectation of future developments we are now at a cornerstone moment in the history of our world.  Now is the time to set the framework for limiting future conflicts, between regions and countries within those regions.
