To understand the Causes of War for AUKUS and Russia the Causes of War in of the Western Civilization must be covered.  And before covering them and the history of Japan it only makes sense to cover the history of the Causes of War in the Nomadic Steps.  This is also important if we are to consider the hypothetical and progressively less likely scenario of the loss and reclamation of Chile -> SA -> NA -> EU, where the Northern "barbarians" will act as the necessary covers for the civilizational and historical hearths of Anatoliya, Persia, India and China.
