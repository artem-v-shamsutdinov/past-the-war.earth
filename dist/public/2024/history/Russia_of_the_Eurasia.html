Eurasia's history is marked by the freeing influence of the West and the willful approach of the East. It stands as the gateway between these two ways of thinking and two ways of life.  Russia is at the center of this formation. It has a relatively low population and very vast territory.  Combined with the northern climate this led to the development of wait-and-see progress bursts, aggressively defensive martial culture (and a necessity to centralize) and a mobilization economy.  Being considered a Western country in the East and an Eastern country in the West, Russia offers a way of thinking that blends both perspectives.
