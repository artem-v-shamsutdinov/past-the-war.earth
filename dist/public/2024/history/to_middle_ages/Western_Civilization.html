The Western Civilization starts with Greek democracy of the privileged many, moves to the republic of the powerful few and goes to the more free vassage of the chosen noble.  The pre-colonial stage of feudalism was attained with the help of actively non-violent and proactively propagated Christianity.  With God's help this further developed into moderating Capitalism, which veiled the thread of violence.  The West is perhaps our best hope of attaining non-lethal, non-maiming warfare in the most gradual, less sacrificial way possible.
