Eurasia's history is marked by the freeing influence of the West and the willful approach of the East. It stands as the gateway between these two ways of thinking and two ways of life.  Russia is at the center of this formation. It has a relatively low population and very vast territory.  Combined with the northern climate this led to the development of wait-and-see progress bursts, aggressively defensive martial culture (and a necessity to centralize) and a mobilization economy.  Russia offers a world perspective that is uniquely different from the perspectives of the West and of the East.
