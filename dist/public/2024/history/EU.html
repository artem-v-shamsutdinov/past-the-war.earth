              Europe has been at near constant warfare for the entire history of its
              <u>civilization</u> right until the end of World War II. Can it stay free of deadly
              and maiming conflict in the face of increasing unifying (whole of) North America,
              economically influential China and likely soon to be "sovereign" CIS?
            </p>
            <h2>Early beginnings</h2>
            <p>
              Over thousands of years agriculture in Europe moved in from (around) Anatolia and was
              present in most of Western and Central Europe by about 7000 years ago. By about 5000
              year ago Europe was largely populated by agricultural communities, havin displaced the
              hunter-gatherer groups.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tradition of constructing metholiths also moved into Europe from Asia Minor and
              slowly spread in Europe, being most prominent from between 7000 and 3200 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around 6200 years ago Indo-Europeans started migrating from Southeast Europe and by
              about 3000 years ago spread throughout Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writing system was first established in Europe in the Minoan civilization of about
              4700 years to 3500 ago. It was succeeded by the Mycenaean civilization of about 2800
              to 3100 years ago, which was the first distinctively Greek civilization, with distinct
              city-states. At about the same time the Etruscan civilization in Italy also consisted
              of city-states.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Western and Central Europe the Celtic Hallstatt culture spread between about
              3200 and 2500 years ago. The proto-Celtic language became the lingua franca of most of
              Europe in that time period.

              It had a polytheistic ideology of Gods living on a not-too-distant mountain, having
              their own society and life and interacting with the inferior, mortal humans from
              above. Humans were pawns in the intrigues of Gods but were capable of achieving
              greater levels of independent existence through their deeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Athens (continuously populated for at least 5000 years) inherited the collective
              experience of the Mycenaean civilization and built a democracy based on the
              inculturated wisdom of the preceding trade empire. It was a trade hub and as all trade
              dominated civilizations was more diverse and open to ideas, which naturally led to the
              logical advancement into democracy. Athens was well ahead of its neighbors, which
              likely led to an ideology of exceptionalism, making wars with inferior opponents more
              justified.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before and since its democratic beginnings about 2,500 years ago Athens has been
              involved in a number of wars. Coalitions of different states entered offensive and
              defensive conflicts and Athens was right in their midst. Eventually Athens became an
              empire by usurping the rights of its former allies. Violence was much closer to
              everyone's daily lives then it is in the majority of our societies today - being a
              pacifist state equated to letting neighboring states take over. The Athenian empire
              did not engage in the war of conquest - which perhaps serves as proof of democracies
              being less militant than more centralized forms of governance.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that the democracy developed in Greece was limited to
              non-slave, land owning men with prior military service - a natural extension of the
              socio-economic realities of the time. Only about 10% of the Athenian population could
              vote.
            </p>
            <h2>
              The empires of the antique West
            </h2>
            <p>
              The advancements of the Athenian democracy impacted the Macedonian kingdom, which
              followed an ideology of superiority and world domination. It briefly conquered most of
              Greece and the Persian Empire but quickly fell apart. This made evident the pattern
              became very prevalent in pre-democratic Europe, where strong leadership could not be
              transferred into the following generations due to the lack of a system of governance
              that accounted for the interests of a larger group of population.
            </p>
            <p>
              About the same time an oligarchic republic of Rome appeared in modern day Italy.
              Having the violent Romulus vs Remus mythology as its starting point to believe in,
              Rome was driven by internal contradictions between the patricians and the plebeians.
              This regionally superior ideology caused it to succeed in natural power expansion
              conflicts on the Italian peninsula and gain the advantageous centrally controlling
              position in the Mediterranean Sea (after conquering the competing Carthage).
            </p>
            <p>
              The oligarchic Republic was fragile and limited its ability to expand. Military
              reforms aimed at strengthening the Republic's fighting force democratized its ranks,
              at the cost of the troops having a much greater sense of loyalty to their generals
              than to the Republic, which did not sufficiently defend their rights. This led to the
              authority of the senate being circumvented by the hidden Triumvirate of the 3 leading
              generals and shortly after that the Republic became an empire - dominated by a supreme
              military commander with the implied goal of maintaining and expanding the ruled
              domain.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the same timeframe Christian faith (and ideology) spread through Rome and caused
              drastic changes. Christianity was a paradigm shift from the emperor holding the status
              of a God to a commoner being bestowed a God like status. It simplified and expanded
              the forward ideas of ancient Jewish wisdom (which distilled monotheism) making it
              universal. Christian ideology undermined the slave system on which the Roman society
              was based on and greatly contributed to the demise of the Roman Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the end of the 5th century, due the various migrations of peoples in the West Roman
              Empire and several wars there was virtually no central control of the imperial
              domains. Only the East Roman Empire persisted, with its own orthodox ideological spin
              that promoted central control (with the early schisms between the churches taking
              place in the mid 5th century). It split off from the Western Empire (arguably) in the
              early 4th century and reached its largest domain in the 6th century, covering most of
              the Mediterranean. Dubbed the Greek East, its lingua franca was the Greek language.
              Subsequent conflicts with Persia and the muslim Caliphate reduced its domains. At the
              turn of the 13th century its capital Constantinople was sacked by Crusaders and the
              empire temporarily dissolved. By the end of the century it reconstituted but was only
              a regional power. It finally fell to the Ottomans in the mid 15th century.
            </p>
            <h2>The Post-Roman Europe</h2>
            <p>
              After Rome fell to hordes of peoples migrating in a number of Barbarian Kingdoms were
              founded in its territory. To legitimize their rule the new kings tried to connect
              themselves to the Roman empire. Over time the formal ties to Rome disappeared and
              kings assumed full control. While inheriting Christianity and Latin kingdoms built
              their own identity but were fragile. At the turn of the 8th century the expansionist
              Carolingian Empire covered most of Western Europe but (lacking advanced governance
              transition system) was divided between the dynastical successors and fell into civil
              war.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Carolingian Empire declined in part due to the raids of the northern barbarians
              (Vikings) that terrorized northern (and to a degree most) parts of Europe with
              indiscriminate violence. Probably for a combination of reasons and driven by a
              relatively primitive ideology of warfare, the new wealth of the south and aided by the
              lack of central command in the subject areas they looted the neighboring south for
              persons and resources. As they raided they also began to settle the accessible areas
              and eventually integrate into local societies. Subsequently Normans, the descendants
              of the Vikings, settled in Northern France, conquered England and (briefly) Southern
              Italy.
            </p>
            <h2>The Feudal System</h2>
            <p>
              With the diminished power of the imperial system of governance mounted
              soldiers/knights began to administer the land and started hereditary rule. From the
              9th century and into the 15th century the Feudal System took hold in Europe. The
              society was divided into the nobility, the clergy and the peasantry. To support
              themselves and the lords the peasants worked the land around fortified manor houses
              (castles) from which lords controlled the nearby area. Lords had reciprocal military
              and legal obligations to their suzeren. Ideology and knowledge were upkept by the
              clergy in monasteries.
            </p>
            <p>
              The feudal system largely replaced slavery in Europe (either abruptly around the turn
              of the 11th century or gradually from the 4th to the 10th century), with the
              additional driver of suppression of slavery of Christians by the Church.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lords were nobles who held land, vassals were granted possession of the land by the
              lords and provided (most importantly) military services to the lord. The vast majority
              of the population were peasants who worked the land and were subdivided into either
              slaves, semi-free serfs (who could only be sold collectively and with their land) or
              free tenants (who were a minority). In theory it was the free men that had the
              military duties placed on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              This appeared to be a very natural system of incentivising the maintenance of
              defensive capabilities. The system of serfdom was present in Greek Sparta and land
              grants were introduced by the above mentioned military reform of Rome (which led to
              the demise of the Republic, being replaced by the Empire).
            </p>
            <p>
              As the Middle Ages progressed professional armies and mercenaries became more common.
              For that reason (with nobility no longer significantly contributing to armies) and
              because as the result of Black Death peasants gained much more autonomy, the military
              dimension of Feudalism ended by 1500.
            </p>
            <p>
              Arguably a series of crop failures and famines lead to the economic shift from the
              feudal system to the resource seeking capitalism, which in turn caused a disbalance
              between the nominally influential feudal lords and resource holding city elites (and
              the resulting creation of revolutionary movements like the Freemasons). The political
              feudal order ended a few centuries later with the course of events accelerated by the
              French Revolution, right before the turn of the 19th century and largely finished with
              the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in the mid 19th century.

              The beginnings of European states
            </h2>
            <p>
              Due to time constraints not all EU members will be covered below:
            </p>
            <h3>
              Central European beginnings
            </h3>
            <p>
              While the European lords were united by the Christian ideology they continued conquest
              against each other, building empires that continued to look to Rome for ideological
              backing. After a long lapse the title of the "Emperor of the Romans" was introduced at
              the turn of the 9th century. After the fall of the Carolingian empire (and a lapse
              lasting several decades) the Holy Roman Empire took on the role of Rome's successor in
              the mid 10th century and lasted into the 19th century (but partially collapsed due to
              overextension) until the Napoleonic wars. Though it never claimed to rule the restored
              West Roman Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Holy Roman Empire subjugated most of Italy and unified the Germanic Central
              Europe, holding back further westward expansion of the then pagan Hungarians and
              Slavs. Starting out as a feudal state, its governance depended on mutual cooperation
              between the emperor and the vassals. The Emperor's legitimacy rested on the fact that
              he inherited power from the ancient emperors of Rome, considering him the first among
              equals in all of Europe's Catholic monarchs.
            </p>
            <h3>Beginnings of Denmark</h3>
            <p>
              The Roman and the Carolingian empires came close to the borders of Denmark who were
              among the people known as Vikings. As part of the Viking raids Danes besieged Paris
              and the Loire Valley in the 10th century. Subsequently a group of Danes was given
              permission to settle northwestern France promising to defend the coastal area against
              further attacks and establishing Normandy. During the age of the North Sea Empire of
              the late Viking age (in the early 11th century) England had completely submitted to
              Danes. By the late 13th century as a result of conflicts between the king, nobles and
              the church a charter was created which is considered the first constitution of
              Denmark.
            </p>
            <h3>Swedish beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              Swedish recorded history starts in the 11th century. Statehood estimates of Sweden
              range from the 6th to the 16th century with some laws present from the 13th century.
              By late 14th century Sweden began unification with Norway and Denmark, leading to the
              Kalmar union of the 15th and early 16th centuries. In the later stages of the union
              Sweden rebelled and elected a separate king.
            </p>
            <h3>Beginnings of France</h3>
            <p>
              After the Carolingian empire France became very decentralized with authority of the
              king being largely religious. This peaked in the 11th century when the provinces were
              de-facto governed independently. The vassals in name only increasingly asserted more
              authority and built some of the strongest states in Europe, with the most famous
              example being the Normans. France became truly centralized in the mid 13th century.
              From then royal attacks on the barons strengthened the monarchy and the authority of
              the king gradually became more accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a series of french led Crusades, two royal houses claimed the throne and the
              Hundred Year's War period ensued. It is during this time that French Nationalism was
              born, represented by the iconic Joan of Arc. Absolute sovereignty in France wasn't
              established until the 16th century.

            <h3>Germanic beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              Christianity was introduced in Western Germany during Roman times. Subsequently
              invasion of the Huns triggered the Migration Period with the Germanic people
              (including the Vandals) moving into Western Roman Empire. Leading to the formation of
              the Holy Roman Empire a series of Duchies constituted the traditional Germanic
              territory. They were finally abolished and broken down into smaller units in 1180.
              German monarchies expanded North and East and founded a series of border countries,
              including Austria.
            </p>
            <h3>Dutch beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              In the 10th and 11th centuries the Holy Roman Empire wasn't able to maintain the
              political unity of the Low Countries of the modern Netherlands. The city states of the
              area were in almost constant war or in defensive unions. Frankish settlement led to
              creation of the Old Dutch language and identity. At the turn of the 12th century local
              farmers began cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the west, which provided the
              resource base to the creation of the centralized County of Holland. A series of wars
              between 1350 and 1490 led to the creation of the Habsburg Netherlands.
            </p>
            <h3>Italian beginnings</h3>
            <p>As a result of the Gothic War in mid-6th century Italy, Germanic Lombards gradually
              took over Italy. Threatened Papacy appealed to the Franks who defeated the Lombards in
              the mid-8th century and allowed for the establishment of Papal States in central
              Italy. After the power of the Charlemagne Empire began to decrease the Papal states
              were threatened by the Caliphates in the South and the defense-united city states in
              the North.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Papacy regained its authority in the 11th century with the recovery of trade. In
              the early 12th century the Pope regained the ability to install bishops (while
              consulting with the Holy Roman empire in case of controversy). In the late 12th
              century the Lombard League city-states of the North warred for and won autonomy from
              the Holy Roman Empire, while the Normans ended Muslim rule in the South.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the 13th century the northern states prospered through commerce and were ruled by
              oligarchical governments. From that evolved merchant republic with the Republic of
              Venice being the most prominent one. By the 14th century Florence, Lucca, Genoa,
              Venice, Siena and other states became rich financial and commercial centers. From the
              10th century the coastal cities built increasingly capable fleets to protect trade.
              Venice and Genoa controlled trade with the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate. Their
              fleets were leading the effort of transporting Crusaders to the Holy Land. By then
              Rome was largely in ruins and the pooper Papal States had little law and order and the
              Papacy relocated north.

              Iberian beginnings
            </h3>
            <p>
              After the post-roman domination of the Visigothic Kingdom, Hispania fell to the Muslim
              conquests in the early 8th century. Almost immediately the Reconquista began with
              Christian forces finally recapturing all of Spain by 1492. In 1095 Portugal broke away
              from the Kingdom of Galicia. Subsequently in the mid-13th century the Muslim Moors
              conquered the North of the country and Lisbon became the capital. In the late 14th
              century the Portuguese defeated the Castilians and established a political alliance
              with England.

              Slavic beginnings
            </h3>
            <p>
              First Slavs in recorded history existed between the German tribes in the West and the
              nomadic Sarmatians in the East since the 1st century in at least the present day
              Poland. Their descendants appeared at the Byzantine frontier in the early 6th century.
              They were described as democratically ruled barbarians that believed in one god to
              whom they made sacrifices. The prevalent Eastern Homeland theory states that as the
              Germanic tribes were fleeing the Huns, Slavs expanded west into their territory
              becoming the West Slavs, southward to modern day Austria and the Balkans becoming the
              South Slavs and northward becoming the East Slavs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first known Slavic state was Samo's Empire which was a tribal union of West slavic
              tribes including the Czechs and existed in the early to mid 7th century. Its successor
              was the Great Moravia of the 9th century that spanned the modern east of Germany,
              south of Poland, Czech and Slovak, east of Austria, Hungary, west of Romania and north
              of Serbia. It disintegrated after the Hungarian invasion around the year 900.

              Southern and Eastern Slavs
            </h3>
            <p>
              In the late 7th century The First Bulgarian Empire was founded north of the Byzantine
              Empire as an alliance between the Bulgars and Southern Slavs. It lasted into the 11th
              century (when, after sieging Constantinople and a series of wars it surrendered to the
              Byzantine Empire) and was the Slavic cultural center where the Cyrillic alphabet was
              invented. It was succeeded by the Second Bulgarian Empire of late 12th to the early
              15th centuries when it fell to the Ottomans.

            <h3>
              Polish beginnings
            </h3>
            <p>
              The closest ancestors of Poles were the West Slavic Lechites. They established
              settlements in present day Poland during the Early Middle Ages, starting with the 6th
              century. These were recorded to be tribal in the 9th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Polish state was established in the late 10th century. Very shortly after that
              Christianization of Poland began, which took centuries, with a large push after pagan
              revolt in the early 11th century. Until the mid 11th century Poland was expanding,
              bringing Christianity with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the late 10th century and until late 12th century Poland was involved in a number
              of conflicts with the Kievan Rus'. Subsequently in the 13th century Poland was
              involved in conflicts with the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia. Subsequently the conflicts
              with the Russian state resumed in the early 16th century and culminated with a brief
              occupation of the Tsardom of Russia in the early 17th century. At times, the conflicts
              of various levels continued until the late 20th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the mid 12th century and until the early 14th century Poland underwent a process
              of feudal fragmentation. The monarchy was effectively restored in the early 14th
              century with Poland subsequently expanding eastward by mid-century. In the early 13th
              century a regional ruler formed a military alliance Teutonic Order that soured and
              caused centuries of warfare with the Order and later the German Prussian state. Poland
              finally won the conflict in the late 15th century, expanding westward through feudal
              fiefdom of subjugated areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid 13th century Poland was invaded by Mongols who briefly occupied it and
              continued to raid it into the late 13th century. In the late 14th century Poland was
              briefly ruled by Hungary after a monarchial crisis of succession. Common monarchical
              rule between Poland and Hungary was also established in the mid 15th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              Poland developed increasingly close ruling class ties with Lithuania in the 14th to
              16th centuries, with the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late
              16th century. A unitary state was created in the late 18th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              As early as late 11th century Polish nobles held significant influence in the Polish
              state, being able to expel a monarch from the state. In the late 14th century the
              Privilege of Kassa was granted to the Polish nobility, releasing them from many feudal
              duties. The General Parliament was established in Poland also in the late 14th
              century. In the early 15th century the rights of Polish nobility were further
              strengthened by Neminem captivabimus, which guaranteed due process. In the early 16th
              century the Nihil novi act transferred most of the legislative power from monarchy to
              parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the mid 15th century and until the very end of the 17th century Poland underwent
              a number of conflicts with the Ottoman Empire.

              Czech beginnings
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Duchy of Bohemia (or the Czech Duchy) was formed in the late 9th century as part
              of the disintegrating Moravia. At that time Moravia was already under the process of
              Christianization which lasted into the early 10th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              Struggling against the Polish occupation Bohemia and Moravia became parts of the Holy
              Roman Empire at the turn of the 11th century. In the early 13th century the Duchy
              gained in status and became Kingdom of Bohemia was established under the Holy Roman
              Empire and lasted until the end of WWI. In the early 14th century the disputed Duchies
              of Silesia were transferred from Poland to the Kingdom of Bohemia.

            <p>
              From the late 14th century Bohemia and Moravia underwent the popular process of
              theological reformation. After religious wars in the early 15th century the reformists
              submitted to the Roman Catholic Church while allowing them to keep their practices.

              Beginnings of Hungary
            </h3>
            <p>
              A confederation of seven Hungarian (or Magyar) tribes moved into modern Hungarian
              territory and established a state in the late 9th century. Claiming a continuation
              from the earlier Huns they led a number of raids into surrounding territory until
              being defeated in the mid 10th century. Christianization of Hungary ensued
              subsequently in the early 11th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 12th and 13th centuries Hungary expanded its domain to the Balkans. In the
              early 13th century the "Golden Bull" forced constitutional limitations on absolute
              monarchy in Hungary. Subsequently Hungary became the first country with a
              parliamentary supremacy over monarchs.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the mid-13th century Hungary was devastated by the Mongol invasion, losing between
              20% and 50% of its population, with only fortified cities and abbeys surviving the
              attacks. Hungary regained its prosperity in the 14th century and gained a close
              alliance with Poland.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the Check proto-protestant movement Hungary went through anti-feudal and
              anti-clerical revolt in the mid 15th century. At about the same time Hungary fought
              the Ottoman Empire for additional territory and gained its monarchical zenith in the
              late 15th century. Hungary was the second country to experience Renaissance after
              Italy.

              Beginnings of Romania
            </h3>
            <p>
              Dacians were the earliest people recorded as living in modern-day Romania around 2500
              years ago. At the turn of the second century most Dacians were conquered by the Roman
              empire, with at least two subsequent recorded rebellions. Dacia remained under Rome
              until the late 3rd century, when Rome withdrew due to Goth advancements and was also
              populated by the Carpi people. It was briefly reconquered by Rome in the early 4th
              century. Evidence of the formation of the Proto-Romanian language was first recorded
              in the 5th century. There is a debate on the mixed Daco-Roman population being the
              ancestors of modern Romanians.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the late 4th century the region was conquered by Huns and remained under them until
              mid 5th century. Subsequently it was occupied by Gepids until late 6th century and
              then briefly the Lombards and then Avars until late 8th century. Part of modern
              Romanian lands were under the First Bulgarian Empire from the late 7th century with
              more lands being incorporated in the early 9th century. By the 10th century the
              Pechenegs controlled the area. Subsequently the Cumans were present in the 11th and
              12th centuries. The Uzes were also recorded to live in the territory of Romania.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a view that the first Vlach/Wallachian and Romanians appeared in the
              area in the 13th century after migrating north from the Balkans. The Principality of
              Wallachia was founded in the early 14th century (after weakening of the Hungarian
              state by Mongol invasions) and (though often under heavy Ottoman influence) existed
              until the mid 19th century, when it unified with Moldavia and became Romania.

              The Crusades
            </h3>
            <p>
              During the Medieval times the Western and Central Europe were united by the ideology
              of the Latin Church (which now constitutes the majority of the Catholic Church, having
              1.3 billion members). All western European kings had to be confirmed by the Pope. In
              the mid 11th century the East-West schism took place that separated the then slim
              majority of Eastern Christians (now numbering 220 million) from Rome (due to among
              other things the Pope's claim to universal jurisdiction). None-the-less at the end of
              the 11th century Pope proclaimed the First Crusade to promote military support of the
              Byzantine empire. The intent was to reconquer Jerusalem and its surrounding area (the
              Holy Land) from Muslim rule.
            </p>
            <p>
              The initial violent People's Crusade was followed by a more organized ideological
              effort that led to the creation of the Crusader states along the Mediterranean coast
              of the Levant. The European people participating in the crusade wars were motivated by
              the prospects of spiritual salvation, satisfaction of feudal obligations and economic
              or political advantage. The core of the Crusader armies was formed by various
              military-religions orders of knights.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Holy Land Crusader states lasted until the end of the 13th century but the
              Crusades continued in other parts of the world, including the Spanish Reconquista, the
              Northern crusades against pagans and the Orthodox Christian Slavs, crusades against
              Christians in Europe (and the Byzantine Empire) and the crusades against Ottomans.
              Crusades finished by the end of the 16th century.
