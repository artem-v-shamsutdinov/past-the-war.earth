                            From the early beginnings of its history China has considered itself the middle land that
                            exists in the midst of relatively more barbarian surroundings. Until the Western Imperial
                            expansion of the 19th century the term "the Middle Kingdom" and then the more encompassing
                            "All under Heaven" were common. For the bulk of the history of our civilizations it has been
                            the biggest economic and trade force on the planet. In the post-Imperial age the slogan
                            "Striving for Unity" is helping the Chinese people look past their differences and work
                            towards social harmony. At the same time this concept is used to proactively oppose the
                            remaining Western influence over the Chinese state and its territories, including the
                            controversially debated Taiwan.

                        <p>
                            Modern day China is very much about prosperity. It is not interested in conquering its
                            surroundings and would rather enjoy economic leadership achieved through war-preempting
                            means.
                        </p>

                        <h2>The beginnings</h2>
                        <p>
                            China's history begins with 3 demigod Sovereigns. The Human Sovereign was one of them and
                            had a cloud chariot. He was also known as Shennong - a deity/mythological hero in Chinese
                            and Vietnamese folk religions that is also known in Korea and Japan. He taught humans
                            agriculture and is said to be an ancestor/patriarch of the Chinese forebears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The history of agriculture in China starts about 10,000 years ago in areas - the Yellow
                            river basin in the north and Yangtze river basin in the south. The speed of development of
                            agricultural technologies picked up about 4,000 years ago from the steady but slow progress
                            of the Neolithic period. Traditionally Chinese history starts about 4,900 years ago, with
                            the first of the original 5 emperors creating the Chinese nation, after he assumed control
                            over 4,700 years ago. The last two of the 5 emperors are generally mapped to historical
                            figures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The formation of the early Chinese logograms started in the late Neolith, at least 4,500
                            years ago. The modern Chinese writing system acts as the link with the Neolithic period,
                            leading to more realistic and concrete thinking. The communal rice growing Far East culture
                            naturally led to group trust and reliance, while generally distrusting the outsiders. The
                            force that drove unification of the early Chinese society was the Yellow River that had to
                            be collectively controlled to enable irrigation and to prevent flooding.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Ancient China</h2>
                        <p>
                            Per the official record, the first historical dynasty Xia started about 4,100 years ago.
                            After close to 500 years of rule it ended with its last ruler being said to be immoral,
                            lascivious and tyrannical. It was succeeded by the Shang dynasty - the first one with
                            certain archeological evidence. It lasted for over 500 years and by 3,500 years ago was mass
                            producing bronze objects, including weapons. During these times the centrally located young
                            Chinese nation grouped the barbarians around it into the North, East, South and West ones.
                            At least the Western barbarians were considered to be more of military and political rivals
                            than cultural and ethnic foreigners and likely all of the groups had relatively similar
                            languages though interpreters were required. The biggest difference was that the Han people
                            of the Yellow River were agricultural engineers while many barbarian groups lacked
                            agriculture altogether.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Close to 3,100 years ago the Zhou dynasty formed. It was the longest lasting dynasty and
                            spanned close to 800 years. To justify taking over the partially shamanic and sacrificial
                            Shang, Zhou introduced the concept of the "Mandate of Heaven" to return good governance to
                            the people. The rule with the mandate was duty-bound to uphold Harmony and Honor. This
                            naturally put a lot of pressure on the top tiers of the society to come up with a system
                            that worked well and to make some sense of the horror of war.
                        </p>
                        <h2>The first feudal system</h2>
                        <p>
                            Even before Roman times the first Feudal System on the planet evolved in China. Having the
                            "Harmony and Honor mandate of heaven" the early Zhou kings raised armies and led conquests
                            of expansion against the surrounding barbarians (though their armies included barbarians as
                            well). Internally emperors divided the land among their feudal lords, who further subdivided
                            it between their dependents and so on until the very bottom of the order. The Zhou ruled not
                            from castles but from walled cities and landless knights were expected to be more scholars
                            than warriors (naturally filling in the absence of a class of clergy). None-the-less the
                            distribution of land and power between the nobles led to a process of decentralization and
                            states that made up the empire started to war with each other.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Spring and Autumn</h2>
                        <p>
                            After a period of re-consolidation efforts the warring states gained enough power to openly
                            defy the king and a long period of chaotic and violent Spring and Autumn ensued about 2,700
                            years ago. The early lords of the period that attained hegemony would proclaim to be the
                            defenders of the traditional order, the Zhou authority and expellers of Barbarians. By 2,600
                            years ago the interstate conflict led to more fragmentation with even more conflict within
                            the warring states. Some efforts at achieving peace took place but by then the various
                            states attained their own spheres of control, continued outward expansion and assimilation
                            of non-Zhou peoples and the old Zhou balance was never restored. New aristocratic houses
                            were established that were loyal to the states directly and not to the overall Zhou empire
                            and Zhou kings lost much of their previous prestige. Through warfare states would
                            consolidate and disintegrate but the war continued.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Hundred Schools of Thought</h2>
                        <p>
                            In this period of lack of central control and competing interests (and during the following
                            Warring States period) different Chinese philosophies developed in different states. The
                            "Hundred Schools of Thought" developed between 2,600 and 2,200 hundred years ago and
                            included schools of Confucianism, Taoism, Yin-yang, Mohism and Legalism. Confucianism
                            proclaimed "let the ruler be a ruler and the subject be a subject", with kings needing to be
                            virtuous and the social stratification being a fact of life sustained by ethical values.
                            Taoism treated the individual as belonging to the natural realm first and only then to the
                            society, preaching avoidance of excessive interference. Yin-yang attempted to explain the
                            universe in terms of basic forces of nature. The short-lived Mohism proclaimed everyone's
                            equality before heaven and preached "universal love", placing the human ethical problem in
                            impartiality of compassion. Legalism argues that human nature is selfish and strict
                            discipline and enforcement of law is required.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is also during this time that the School of Military developed as well. It is as part of
                            this school that Sun Tzu's The Art War was written. Its first chapter proclaimed that war is
                            a very grave matter for the state and must not be commenced without due consideration. All
                            important aspects must be considered before a war is started.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Warring States</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Spring and Autumn period transitioned into the period of Warring States that saw
                            bureaucratic and military reforms and consolidation. Many state rulers claimed the Mandate
                            of Heaven to justify conquest. The rulers no longer proclaimed vassalage to the Zhou dynasty
                            and proclaimed their kingdoms to be fully independent. Alliances were formed and some
                            stability finally started to appear. Many philosophers and tacticians traveled around the
                            states arguing that their teachings should be implemented. Finally the Qin state adopted the
                            ideology of "attack not only the territory but also the people" that advocated mass
                            slaughter. The Qin state conquered the remaining Zhou territory and ended the Zhou dynasty.
                            It then conquered the remaining states and its king proclaimed himself "The First Sovereign
                            Emperor of Qin".
                        </p>
                        <h2>Qin</h2>
                        <p>
                            After territorial consolidation the new state started to consolidate the philosophies that
                            drove the behavior of its newly conquered citizens. Over 2,200 years ago the Qin victors
                            burned books and executed philosophers, imposing the official governing philosophy of
                            Legalism (though overtime Confucianism and Taoism recovered and became the two dominant
                            Chinese ideologies). Throughout the Warring States period the scale of destruction was
                            continuously escalated with millions being killed in combat. This bloodshed drove Chinese
                            society into preferring a unified throne.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Han</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Qin dynasty was short lived and was replaced by the Han dynasty, which lasted over 400
                            years that are considered to be the classical era of China. It officially sanctioned
                            Confucianism, started mass production of paper and written documents and was technologically
                            on par with contemporary Rome. Buddhism was introduced to China during this time. Through
                            its imperial conquest it entered into a long conflict with a confederation of northern
                            nomadic tribes and expanded further.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 2,100 years ago the Han dynasty expanded further South, conquered Northern Vietnam
                            and put down rebellions. Chinese rule in Northern Vietnam lasted until the mid 10th century.
                            At about the same time northern Korea was conquered by the same Han dynasty. It set up
                            commanderies in Korea which lasted until the early 4th century.

                        <p>
                            Between Western and Eastern Han dynasty periods (at the turn of the 1st century) the short
                            lived Xin dynasty attempted a number of reforms including outlawing of slavery and land
                            redistribution. They were not successful and slavery continued in China into the early 20th
                            century. In the mid 20th century the Communist government instituted harsh punishments for
                            it and slavery was virtually eliminated.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Six Dynasties</h2>
                        <p>
                            Internal conflicts led to the decline of the Han dynasty and after a period of chaotic
                            infighting between warlords at the turn of the 3rd century, the bloody period of Three
                            Kingdoms ensued, with all 3 claiming sovereignty over all of China.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 3rd century the Jin dynasty briefly reunited China, with a subsequent loss of
                            northern China, which fragmented into the Sixteen Kingdoms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the early 5th century and until late 6th century two parallel regimes ruled the
                            northern and southern halves of China. Buddhism spread widely during this period and
                            eventually became acceptable to Taoists.

                            At the turn of the 7th century the short-lived Sui dynasty once again reunified China. It
                            started a number of very successful policies that were copied by later dynasties.

                            Age under the Tang dynasty. During this period the most famous Chinese poets created their
                            poems, music and literature flourished and Buddhism gained a temporary but significant
                            influence. Woodblock printing was introduced, geographical and historical literary works
                            were created. Throughout this and following periods Imperial China contended for control of
                            Inner (Central) Asia to secure its west bound trade routes and gain influence.

                            Subsequently in early to mid 10th century the country once again fell into disunity during
                            the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

                        <h2>Late imperial period</h2>
                        <p>
                            By the late 10th century the Song dynasty reunified most of Inner China. The Song dynasty
                            introduced true paper money and established a permanent standing navy. During this period
                            gunpowder weapons and bombs were invented. And it was then that the imperial examination of
                            officials started to dominate and the elites shifted from being military-aristocratic to
                            being scholar-bureaucratic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Jin dynasty was established in the early 12th century after it successfully rebelled
                            against and overthrew the Liao dynasty. Subsequently Jin conquered the northern part of the
                            Song dynasty along with most of the north of China, with the exception of the area south of
                            modern Mongolia, controlled by the Western Xia dynasty.

                            By the late 13th century the Chinese adopted New-Confucianism that used metaphysics as a
                            guide for developing a rationalist ethical philosophy. It became a way to safeguard the
                            cultural heritage of China after the Mongol conquest.

                        <h2>Yuan dynasty</h2>
                        <p>
                            By the late 13th century the Mongol Empire conquered all of China and established the Yuan
                            dynasty, which lasted until the late 14th century. The Yuan dynasty centralized the
                            government and brought in non-Hans from outside of China to fill government posts. By its
                            end the Yuan dynasty was widely unpopular due to incompetent governance and was overthrown
                            by a popular rebellion.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Ming dynasty</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 14th century the Yuan dynasty was replaced by the Ming dynasty, that is known
                            for. During this period the new-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were
                            confiscated by the government and rented out to independent peasant landholders. Slavery was
                            forbidden for non-state actors. At the same time the rule became more autocratic. The
                            defensive fortifications of the Great Wall were rebuilt. Under the Ming dynasty a large navy
                            was built and China explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa. Several maritime
                            Asian nations became tributaries. Towards the end of the dynasty China became increasingly
                            isolated.

                        <h2>Qing Dynasty</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 17th century the Qing Dynasty was founded by the conquest of northern Manchus. In
                            the mid to late 18th century Qing extended control into Inner Asia. In the mid 19th century
                            China lost the Opium wars to the British Empire and was forced to sign unequal treaties with
                            the major western imperial centers. At about the same time several rebellions (including
                            ideologically led ones) weakened central imperial authority and led to civil wars with
                            massive loss of life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Central rule declined and many provinces were ruled independently using local military
                            forces for support. In the late 19th century several reforms were made in an attempt to
                            build up the military industrial complex and strengthen the military.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the turn of the 20th century an uprising against foreign influence led to a war of the
                            Chinese empire against the major colonial states of the time, resulting in another unequal
                            treaty.

                        <p>
                            Between 1894 and 1895 the loss in the First Sino-Japanese War demonstrated a failure in the
                            attempts to modernise the Chinese military.

                        <p>
                            After a decade of uprisings in 1911 the Xinhai Revolution ended the Qing dynasty. In 1912
                            the Republic of China was established. After a period of an initial period of struggle in
                            1916 the Warlord Era of constant civil war ensued until 1928, with a subsequent gradual
                            reunification of China.

                            In the 1910s and 1920s the New Culture Movement started, which criticized classical Chinese
                            ideas and promoted modern ideals. After the end of WWI former German colonies in China were
                            transferred to imperial Japan. This caused mass protests and grew into the anti-imperialist,
                            nationalist May Fourth Movement.

                            From 1927 to 1937 the Chinese Civil War was fought between the National Revolutionary Army
                            and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, resulting in Nationalists controlling most
                            of China.

                            In 1931 Japanese forces invaded Manchuria and continued small territorial attacks until they
                            launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937, starting the Second Sino-Japanese War. From
                            then and until 1945 various parts of the country were occupied by imperial Japan. During
                            this war the imperial Japan's forces committed war crimes on a massive scale, mostly against
                            civilians. It is estimated that 20 million deaths have been caused by this war.

                            The two forces fighting the Chinese civil war nominally formed a United Front to oppose the
                            Japanese in 1936. The clashes between the Communist forces and the Nationalist forces
                            continued and effectively prevented their cooperation against the imperial Japanese forces.

                        <p>
                            From 1945 to 1949 the civil war resumed as soon as the defeat of imperial Japan was
                            imminent. It was fought between the Republic of China Armed Forces and the People'
                            Liberation Army. During the war both sides carried out mass atrocities, including those
                            against non-combatants. It resulted in the victory of the PLA and establishment of the
                            People's Republic of China in the mainland and the retreat of the Republic of China to
                            Taiwan. This started a standoff between the two sides, both of which claim to be the
                            legitimate government of all China. The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1958 was described as
                            the "first serious nuclear crisis". Open conflict ended in 1979.

                            In 1971 the United Nations recognized the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate
                            representative of China. The Nationalist Party ruled Taiwan under martial law until 1987,
                            with the goal of retaking mainland China. Its continuous rule ended in 2000.

                            On the mainland, the People's Republic of China attempted industrialization between 1958 and
                            1962, which largely failed and caused the Great Chinese Famine which killed tens of millions
                            of people. Between 1966 and 1976 internal command struggles led to wide-spread violence and
                            massive loss of life during the Cultural Revolution.

                            The Chinese Communist Party has been supported by the Soviet Union since its formation.
                            Starting with the late 1950s the relations between PRC and the Soviet Union were
                            continuously deteriorating due to doctrinal divergences. Throughout the 1970s China improved
                            its relations with the Western block, culminating in full diplomatic recognition of China by
                            the USA in 1979. The relations were temporarily suspended in 1989 after the massacre during
                            the Tiananmen Square Protests.
