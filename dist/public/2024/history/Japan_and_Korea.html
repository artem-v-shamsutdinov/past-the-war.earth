                                If Japan's civilization had to be described by one visualisation,
                                the famous picture of the huge wave over Mount Fuji would probably
                                work best. Thus, it could be argued that it has attained its
                                unparalleled cultural refinement (which is likely our best hope for
                                long term survival in the cosmic world) and military might
                                (necessary to maintain our independence) through the natural facts
                                of its existence. Japan is once again prioritising its defense.

                            Korea's location between China, Russia and Japan forces it to balance
                            between greater forces. In the face of changing generational preferences
                            North Korea is changing its peninsular policy, while South Korea is
                            increasing its regional influence, expressing willingness to work with
                            "not like minded" states and is proactively seeking a renewal of the
                            international order.

                        <p>
                            Between 3,000 and 2,800 years ago cultural and technological changes
                            brought from the mainland lead to increased population density in Japan,
                            increased stratification of society and tribal warfare. Gradually tribal
                            formations were replaced by early kingdoms. During the 2nd century a
                            civil war led to an establishment of a stronger state and a
                            consolidation of chiefdoms.

                        <p>
                            The Japanese ideology has its roots in the Shinto religion, a
                            decentralized, polytheistic and anamistic set of beliefs. It focuses on
                            the harmony between humans and spirits through rituals, with a
                            particular focus on cleansing. It doesn't focus on particular moral
                            codes or afterlife outcomes of one's behavior during life. Starting with
                            the 6th century Buddhism entered Japan and merged with Shinto. Initial
                            introduction led to religious warfare.

                        <h3>Kofun & Asuka periods</h3>
                        <p>
                            Probably starting in the 4th century an alliance of tribal nobles was
                            formed as the first unified state in central Japan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 4th and early 5th centuries Japanese troops participated in
                            a war in Korea, fought between competing Korean fractions. In the mid
                            7th century a war against an expanding peripheral ethnic group was
                            successfully fought by the state. Also in the mid 7th century Japanese
                            troops participated in another Korean conflict.

                            After the introduction of Buddhism from Korea, Japan was de facto
                            controlled by the Buddhist faction from late 6th to the early 7th
                            century. In the mid 7th century a coup led to a series of reforms
                            interrupted by a war of succession in the late 7th century. These
                            reforms led to a creation of a centralized government and institution of
                            the former title of Emperor.

                        <h3>Nara & Heian Periods</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the early 8th century first written records of the Japanese creation
                            myth appeared, describing imperial line as being descendants of the
                            gods. During the 8th century there was an intense struggle for influence
                            between the Imperial monarchs, leading nobile clans and Buddhist
                            priests. This struggle led to the start gradual removal of control from
                            the Imperial monarchy to the leading clan in the mid 9th century which
                            continued until the late 11th century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 8th century Japan suffered a series of natural disasters and
                            outbreaks of disease which killed over a quarter of the population.
                            Another disease outbreak in the early 9th century killed almost half of
                            the population.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the late 8th century to the early 9th century the Thirty-Eight
                            Years' War of successful imperial expansion was fought.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 11th century a war of succession continued the struggle for
                            control between the samurai clans and led to Imperial victory. In the
                            late 11th century another war continued open hostilities between the
                            clans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of the period in the late 12th century the struggles for
                            internal influence weakened the central state and led to creation of
                            regional centers with their own armies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 12th century a civil war resulted in the establishment of a
                            military dictatorship - Shogunate, which largely controlled the country
                            until the late 19th century, with the Imperial monarchy being reduced to
                            being only a symbolic leadership as a source of legitimacy.

                        <h3>Kamakura period</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Kamakura period of the shogunate dynastical rule saw the emergency
                            of the warrior caste of samurai and the establishment of feudalism in
                            Japan, with the adoption of Japan's first military code of law in the
                            early 13th century. Vassals were allowed to maintain their own armies
                            and institute their own regional law and order. Also during this period
                            Buddhist ideology was expanded into Old Buddhism and New Buddhism and
                            widely spread among the samurai class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the early 13th century an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the
                            shogunate led to a civil war.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 13th century all of the armies of Japan were mobilised to
                            fight two wars against a naval invasion by the forces of the Mongol
                            Empire. The war led to victory but overextended the Japanese state. It
                            failed to compensate its vassals for their service which led to
                            permanent deterioration of ties between the shogunate and the samurai
                            class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The conflict with the vassals ultimately led to a war in the early 14th
                            century which ended the Kamakura shogunate.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Muromachi period</h3>
                        <p>
                            The following shogunate started with a long period of instability and
                            civil war during the mid and late 14th century, with the shogunate
                            finally restoring unity by the end of the century. Subsequently the
                            regional rulers (daimyos) increased in influence. This led to a balance
                            for control over the state between these regional rulers and the
                            shogunate.

                        <p>
                            In the early 15th century the forces of the Korean Joseon state
                            attempted an invasion against Japanese pirate bases in the middle of the
                            Tsushima Strait between Korean and Japan. Militarily inconclusive, it
                            resulted in new trade agreements between Korea and Japan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 15th century a regional dispute escalated into a nationwide
                            civil war. This resulted in a century of anarchy with widespread revolts
                            of peasants and samurai. During this period a greater multitude of more
                            fragmented daimyos struggled to dominate the entirety of Japan. This was
                            the period with a pronounced despotism of the nobility against the
                            peasantry, resulting in the increased armament of the latter.

                            In the mid 16th century the Portuguese arrived, with a subsequent
                            arrival of missionaries, starting a period of Western colonialism which
                            lasted until the early 17th century. The Spanish trade colonizers
                            arrived in the late 16th century, followed by the Dutch in the early
                            17th century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 16th century the first recorded naval battle between
                            Europeans and Japanese took place, with a victory of the Portuguese, who
                            gained increased influence as a result.

                            In the late 16th century Japanese pirates (along with Chinese and
                            Koreans) participated in a battle with Spanish forces in the
                            Philippines. This resulted in Spanish victory and reduction of pirate
                            activity in the area.

                            In the late 16th century two Japanese invasions of Korea took place,
                            with an intent to conquer the Korean Peninsula as well as China. They
                            resulted in a military stalemate between the Chino-Korean alliance and
                            the Japanese forces and the withdrawal of Japanese forces.
                        </p>

                            By the late 16th century the continuous civil war resulted in a period
                            of consolidation of central control over the country. At the turn of the
                            17th century a decisive victory of the "Western Army" over the "Eastern
                            Army" led to the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate.

                        <p>
                            Per existing (widely accepted) archaeological evidence, the first
                            agricultural societies in Korea started to appear about 3500 years ago.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Gojoseon</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to mythology, the first Korean kingdom of Gojoseon was founded
                            in the north about 4,450 years ago and certainly existed as a
                            centralized kingdom since at least 2,400 years ago and was well known in
                            China. Around 2,300 years ago the Jin state in South Korea was formed as
                            (likely) a federation of smaller states. By 2,100 years ago North Korea
                            was conquered by the Han dynasty of China and Jin state in the South
                            evolved into a confederacy. Subsequently the Proto-Three Kingdoms period
                            started before the subsequent Three Kingdoms were fully formed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 2300 years ago Gojoseon lost territory to the Yan dynasty of
                            China as a result of a war. As a result of another war around 2200 years
                            ago Gojoseon gained more autonomy from Yan. Finally around 2100 years
                            ago Gojoseon was defeated and annexed by the following Han dynasty,
                            which created four commanderies in its territory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During its existence Gojoseon maintained close relations with Japan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the fall of the Gojoseon and before maturation of the following
                            Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla kingdoms Korea entered into the Proto-Three
                            Kingdoms period. It lasted until the turn of the 4th century when the
                            Three Kingdoms began to dominate the peninsula.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Three Kingdoms</h3>
                        <p>
                            Among other kingdoms like Gaya the three kingdoms share a similar
                            culture and language. In the 3rd century Buddhism was introduced in
                            Korea from China, soon becoming the state religion, starting with
                            Goguryeo in the late 4th century. Prior to that Korea largely held
                            shamanic beliefs, which survive to this day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Approaching 2100 years ago (subsequent to the destruction of Gojoseon)
                            the northern kingdom of Goguryeo was founded, growing with the gradual
                            retreat of the Chinese commanderies and conquering neighboring tribes. 
                            After the fall of the Chinese Han dynasty and initial cooperation with
                            the new Cao Wei dynasty against a commandery, Goguryeo lost a war
                            against the Cao Wei in the mid 3rd century. Goguryeo  temporarily lost
                            its capital and was nearly destroyed.  In the early 4th century Goguryeo
                            conquered the remaining Chinese commandery.  In the mid 4th century
                            Goguryeo was at war with the Xianbeis nomads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also at about the same time the western kingdom of Baekje was founded.
                            It became a great maritime state, helping to spread Buddhism throughout
                            East Asia, including Japan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At about the same time the eastern kingdom of Silla was founded,
                            starting from a city-state and incorporating people fleeing from a
                            chinese commandery and later the supponding native tribes.  Being the
                            least numerous and weakest state it built pacts and alliances with more
                            prominent states.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around the turn of the 5th century, the alliance of Goguryeo and Silla
                            won a war against the alliance of Baekje and Gaya states and Japan. As a
                            result Japan was expelled from Korean affairs and Silla became a
                            protectorate of Goguryeo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Between the late 1st and the mid 6th century Silla was in a long term
                            armed conflict with Gaya and Baekje. Final result was Gaya being
                            absorbed into Silla and Baekje.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around the turn of the 6th century and in the early 7th century Goguryeo
                            won a war against the Sui of China, which was the aggressor, greatly
                            contributing to the end of the rule of the Sui dynasty.

                        <h3>North and South States</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 7th century the alliance of Goguryeo, Baekje, Japan and Mohe
                            lost to the alliance of the Tang dynasty of China and Silla. This
                            resulted in the fall of Goguryeo and Baekje and their annexation by
                            Tang, creation of Unified Silla and beginning of territorial disputes
                            between Silla and Tang. In the north the Balhae state expanded into
                            Manchuria.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 7th century Silla and its Goguryeo and Baekje vassalages
                            started a war against the Tang dynasty, winning it and unifying most of
                            the Korean peninsula. Unified Silla carried on the maritime legacy of
                            Baekje, becoming a trade empire of East Asia. Buddhist ideology was most
                            prominent during this time. Unified Silla began to decline in the late
                            8th century and surrendered to Goryeo in the early 10th century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The northern Balhae was at a military conflict with the Tang dynasty
                            until the end of the 8th century. In the early 10th century it was
                            conquered by the Chinese Liao dynasty.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Goryeo dynasty</h3>
                        <p>
                            Goryeo was founded in the early 10 century, deemed to be the successor
                            of Goguryeo and by mid 10th century was the ruling dynasty of Korea. It
                            lasted until the late 14th century, with a period of military control
                            from late 12th to the late 13th centuries. During Goryeo rule Buddhism
                            continued to spread throughout Korea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 10th and the early 11th centuries the Goryeo state was at
                            war with the Liao dynasty of China, which invaded Goryeo and was
                            defeated. As a result Liao seeded territory, in return for tribute and
                            establishment of diplomatic relations, leading to lasting peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Between the 10th and the 14th centuries Goryeo was involved in a number
                            of inconclusive border conflicts with the Jin dynasty and the Jurchens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the early to mid 13th century the Mongol Empire conquered Goryeo,
                            making it a vassal state from the late 13th and the mid 14th centuries.
                            As a vassal Goryeo participated in the failed invasions of Japan by the
                            Mongol Empire, in the late 13th century.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 14th century the Red Turban rebels of China invaded Goryeo
                            and were defeated. Subsequently Goryeo defeated an invading Yuan army.
                            The invasions were repelled and led to eventual the end of Goryeo rule
                            and severe loss of life.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Early and Middle Joseon dynasty</h3>
                        <p>
                            Goryeo was overthrown by the Joseon dynasty in the late 14th century,
                            which lasted until the late 19th century. It institutionalized
                            Neo-Confucianism over the previously dominating Buddhism and
                            consolidated rule over the Korean peninsula.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 14th century Goryeo organized an expedition against Japan's
                            Tsushima province, making it a tributary state. In the early 15th
                            century a subsequent expedition temporarily ended nearby piracy. In the
                            early 16th century after Japanese riots in Korean port cities the
                            economic relationship between the two countries was greatly reduced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the mid 15th century a northern expedition led to the expansion of
                            Korean borders to what they are presently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the late 16th century the Joseon Dynasty aligned with the Ming
                            dynasty of China (being its imperial tributary and an ally) repelled two
                            large scale Japanese invasions. The war resulted in heavy devastation,
                            war atrocities and severe loss of life.

                            In the early to mid 17th century during the rise of the Manchu influence
                            in China, Korea was twice invaded by the Manchu, forcing it to submit to
                            the new dynasty in China, over the previously preferred Ming.
