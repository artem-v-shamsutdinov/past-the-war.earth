After the bulk of the army will be armed with non-lethal, non-maming implements on land, seas naturally become the next
fronteer. Cutting edge weapons will always be required at sea, just as they will allways be required by the coastal land
covering maries, inland covering paratroopers and mountain covering special devisions (and special forces will always be
special). But the it will be the maneuvering that will decide the outcomes of the decisive force training operations,
for they will deal with planetary protection via a cultured approach of comparing capabilities.

The seas specifically have always been about trade as much more economical to move goods by water than even by rail. But
as we are soon to <a href="https://helion-energy.com">find out</a> there will be a new aspect to the seas - deuterium.
The seas become the source of the bulk element of the future of energy, with the "catalyst" helium-3 being synthesised
but possibly at a hefty premium or being mined on the Moon.

The countries that will provide the bulk of sea protection are AUKUS - Atlantics and Pacific, Japan - Central Pacific,
Russia - Arctic, North Pacific and the upcomers China - East Pacific and India - Indian.
