                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The war in Sudan is beginning to cause mass starvation. Soon the lives of millions of people
                            will be at stake. Sudan's internal peace talks failed because of conflicting interests of
                            surrounding and other African and Middle Eastern nations. Most of those countries are
                            themselves neo-colonies to various degrees or at least partially rely on external
                            partnerships for security. Thus they cannot guarantee stability without the involvement of
                            world-wide power holders. The situation is further complicated by Sudan's proximity to the
                            Red Sea that has strategic importance to the world as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Applying maximum pressure to reach a lasting ceasefire in Sudan could greatly further the
                            national interests of the USA. The new special envoy should have direct access to the US
                            Secretary of State and the president of the United States, with assurances of swift action
                            of the highest level offices when needed. He should be given carte blanche abilities to
                            resolve the conflict as soon as possible. All possible measures should be taken to prevent
                            the possibility of the biggest humanitarian crisis since WWII.
                        </p>

                            Gaza
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Insufficient access to water and food is already putting hundreds of thousands of Gazans at
                            the risk of starvation and funding for existing aid could run out by March. Immediate
                            measures must be taken to ensure survival of Gazans. Accomplishing a lasting ceasefire is
                            the best course of action for all parties involved. As part of the current diplomatic
                            effort, agreements must be made to ensure the flow of humanitarian aid to Gazans. Failure to
                            do so now will also destabilize the situation in Israel and in the region as a whole, and
                            will cause a shift in the public opinion in the West as a whole and in the United States
                            specifically.

                        <p>
                            The world security reconfiguring conflict in Ukraine caused a chain reaction that emboldened
                            the positions of conflicting parties in Sudan and spiraled out of control. Achieving peace
                            in Europe will stabilize the security situation of the world as a whole. A stable security
                            balance in the Middle East will be possible, and war in North East Africa will end. The war
                            in Ukraine directly involves the second military power in the world and bringing it to a
                            state of peace will cause positive ripple effects across the globe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Logically, direct military confrontation between NATO and the Russian Federation is not in
                            the interests of either party. The feared Russian defensive interests in the Polish and
                            Bessarabian gaps are overextended and likely non-essential to the survival of the Russian
                            state, given its nuclear deterrent capabilities. And the recent efforts to strengthen NATO
                            forces and logistics in Eastern Europe are sufficient for defense of the EU, provided that
                            there is a buffer zone between the Russian and NATO forces to avoid a rollover effect if
                            Ukraine is partitioned. A neutral Ukraine is in the interests of both parties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is apparent that the difference in the military potential of Ukraine and Russia is beyond
                            comparison. If the war in Ukraine continues the chances of Ukrainian forces to hold ground
                            are very slim. Best case scenario for Ukraine will likely be losing additional territory in
                            the East and South and agreeing to a neutral status under much worse conditions than are
                            possible now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the Russian military commits to a major offensive it may not stop at the Dnieper River
                            and may take Kiev and the rest of central Ukraine. This is the scenario of Ukrainian
                            partition, in which Russian forces come in direct contact with the Polish military and its
                            NATO allies. The chances for accidental escalation of hostilities will be much greater with
                            a potential chain reaction to an all out war, with further possibilities being too horrible
                            to imagine.
                        </p>
                        <h2>When a ceasefire is reached</h2>
                        <p>
                            After a lasting ceasefire is reached in Ukraine, Russia will most likely shift its focus to
                            Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus, where lie its other vital interests. Russian
                            demographics are shifting towards Central Asia and are changing its defence strategy.
                            Western influence in Central Asia is logically of a much greater concern to Russia than
                            Eastern Europe. This influence affects its central territories and limits its efforts to
                            shift its industrial and potentially political center to the middle of the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To accomplish its strategic goals in Central Asia, Russia will have to re-assert its
                            influence over the Southern Caucasus and redirect further integration of Turkik speaking
                            nations. Logically, these Russian efforts will combine with the pressure from Iran that is
                            not interested in an adversarial Azerbaijan. Recent sales of weapons to Armenia are
                            indicating that Turkic integration would shift the balance of power away from Indian
                            interests as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Combination of the above factors will force Turkey to roll back its Turkistan efforts. And
                            the increased NATO connectivity in the Balkans as well as a stronger Eastern European
                            defence will reduce its influence options in Europe. These factors will naturally pivot
                            Turkey's focus to the Middle East. In turn, faced with Turkish pressure, Iran will be forced
                            to cut a deal and moderate its Middle Eastern strategy. This reconfiguration of the balance
                            of power in the region will reduce the level of violence in and related to the
                            Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A possibility of a lasting peace in the Middle East will be in
                            sight. In turn this will stabilize the situation in North East Africa and beyond.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The forces in Sudan will be able to achieve a lasting peace agreement as soon as the
                            external forces that are now driving the conflict will have an agreement. Both Russia and
                            Ukraine are directly involved in Sudan and agreement between them will provide an immediate
                            driver for peace in Sudan. Parallel peace efforts in the Middle East will cause a more
                            peaceful approach from the major and mid-size power holders of that region.

                            The conflict with the biggest implications to world security is in Ukraine. To come to an
                            agreement in Ukraine we must reach a common understanding of the situation there, starting

                            Present day assessments range from "The Globe of Ukraine" to complete marginality of
                            Ukrainian territories. Recent research does place settlements in Ukraine and south west
                            Russian dating to around 5000 years ago, which were subsequently destroyed by early
                            pastorals. The origin of Indo-European languages has also been placed in this area.

                            Since the 9th century Kievan Rus' held the leading positions in Rus'. As part of feudal
                            conflicts in Rus' it declined and lost its independence after being sacked by the
                            Principality of Vladimir in late 12th century. As most of Rus', Kiev's domains were
                            devastated by the subsequent Mongol invasion and subjugated for centuries after that. Kiev
                            still has major cultural and historical significance in the minds of the Russian people.

                            Directly to the west of the Land of Kyiv was the Rus' Prinipality of Halych-Volynia. It
                            sacked Kiev and was independent during the start of the Mongol invasion. At the time it was
                            one of the most powerful kingdoms in East Europe while also being a disputed territory
                            between Poland and Hungary.

                            After a century of conflicts and shifting alliances the entire territory previously
                            belonging to Halych-Volhynia and Kiev's control ended up in Poland, Hungary or Lithuania.
                            Centuries after that, when Poland unified with Lithuania, largely orthodox people of the
                            future Ukrainian territories rebelled against the catholic Poland and joined the Russian
                            Empire, losing their political autonomy in the process.

                            During the time of the Russian Empire the territory of modern Ukraine was a composite of
                            separate regions. Its eastern part to the Dnieper river was added to the Russian empire in
                            the 1650s and Its Southern half of "New Russia" was added in the 1770s when the Ottoman
                            Empire seeded Zaporozhnian Sich to the Russian Empire. In the 1780s the Russian Empire
                            annexed the Crimean Khanate. Ukraine's western territories were incorporated in the 1790s.

                            elevated ethnic Ukrainians to leadership positions. At the same time, in defense preparation
                            for the impending conflict and the drive for industrialization, the pre-WWII Soviet elites
                            caused a horrible famine - Holodomor, which was worst in Ukraine and disillusioned the
                            Ukrainian people to the Soviet ideology.

                            During WWII Ukraine was occupied by the German military and the Ukrainian people split
                            between resistance and guerilla warfare and collaboration, with collaboration being most
                            pronounced in western Ukraine. The Ukrainian nationalists hoped that collaboration would
                            help them re-establish an independent state and participated in the German-supervised police
                            and military or guarded concentration camps. Some followed the Nazi ideology and were
                            involved in the Holocaust in Ukraine and the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern
                            Galicia.

                            During WWII the now western Ukraine was annexed from Poland. In 1954 Soviet leadership
                            transferred the Crimean oblast to the Ukrainian SSR.

                            Ukraine gained its independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. It remained
                            unaligned, poorly managed and was subjected to Asian, Eurasian, European and North American
                            interests. After a series of pro-Russian governments, Ukraine started moving towards EU
                            integration. In 2014 after the Ukrainian leadership suddenly shifted towards integration
                            with Russia a series of protests culminated in the pro-EU Maidan Revolution.

                            Immediately after that two far Eastern oblast' of Ukraine proclaimed independence and the
                            Donbas war started.  The Crimean oblast was annexed by Russia. In an attempt to resolve
                            the war the Minsk Agreements were signed in the same year but failed to stop the fighting. 
                            In 2019 the Ukrainian Constitution was amended with the goal of Ukrainian integration into
                            the EU. In 2020 Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine signed an agreement with the goal of
                            integrating Ukraine into NATO.  In 2021 NATO leaders confirmed eventual integration of
                            Ukraine into NATO.

                            The NATO position
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The defensive view in NATO is that of an imminent Russian expansion in the west, with
                            Ukraine simply being an intermediate stop on the way. The argument is that Russians can't
                            guarantee its security without holding territory of Romania and Poland. Expansion into those
                            countries would lead to direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, with NATO being
                            expected to decisively defeat Russia in conventional warfare. This in turn could lead to
                            Russia escalating to nuclear warfare. Hence, NATO considers stopping Russia's expected
                            expansion to the West in Ukraine by reducing Russia's offensive potential via a decisive
                            defeat.
                        </p>
                        <p>NATO leadership may have realized the mutual benefit of a ceasefire but may be stuck in its
                            aggressive posture until there is a realization of the benefit of a fully neutral Ukraine to
                            all parties involved.</p>
                        <h2>The Ukrainian position</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Maidan Revolution manifested the general choice of the Ukrainian people to integrate
                            with the West. It wasn't a uniform decision and was driven by support in western Ukraine,
                            widely supported in the center of the country and eventually accepted in the east and the
                            south.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Annexation of Crimea by Russia, combined
                            with the separation of the 2 far east oblast it presented a real problem for the Ukrainian
                            state - its territorial integrity was under question, potentially placing its existence
                            under question as well. Having made the decision to integrate with the EU (and thus NATO),
                            starting preparation for war of reunification was the logical course of events.
                        </p>
                        <p>Ukrainian leadership may have realized that the longer the war continues the less is the
                            likelihood of a favorable outcome for the country. However external drivers of the situation
                            leave no chance for Ukraine but to continue the conflict, until there is an agreement
                            between NATO and Russia to reach a ceasefire.</p>
                        <h2>
                            The Russian position
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The build up of Ukrainian military capability was statedly perceived by the Russian military
                            leadership as a significant and direct threat. Perhaps it was assumed that it would lead to
                            eventual placement of strategic weaponry on Ukrainian soil that would severely limit
                            Russia's ability to defend itself and would impact the social and political dynamics in the
                            country. It also placed the south-west of Russia under the threat of severance from the rest
                            of the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ideologically having a culturally close and partially Russian speaking neighbor in the
                            opposing NATO alliance was a direct threat to the Russian state.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These factors could eventually lead to severe weakening of the Russian state and its
                            eventual subjugation by the European Union, possible depopulation and inclusion into the EU,
                            either via partition or wholesale, on the terms of a depopulated resource colony which are
                            clearly not favorable to the Russian citizens.
                        </p>
                        <p>Russian leadership may be realizing that a ceasefire is the best course of action but may be
                            stuck without a way out until a proposal of full Ukrainan neutrality is communicated to it.
                        </p>

                            Resolving the Ukrainian conflict
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The Russian government stated that a ceasefire is only possible if Ukraine is de-militarized
                            and de-nationalized. But those are not the only objectives that could lead to the final
                            Russian goals - acceptable ideological, governmental and economic status of Ukraine. An
                            armed Ukraine with a national identity may acceptable to the Russian leadership as long as
                            there are hard guarantees of Ukraine having:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No Nazi ideology</li>
                            <li>Complete neutrality</li>
                            <li>Equal respect for both EU and Russian security interests</li>
                            <li>Equal integration into both economic blocks</li>
                            <li>Secure status of Russian culture and language</li>
                            <li>Reciprocal allowance for dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The leadership of the Russian Federation is very pragmatic and once it realizes that the core
                            objectives in the Special Military Operation in Ukraine can be achieved it can be flexible
                            on the form of the resulting agreements.  It is time for the Russian leadership to realize
                            that the best time to achieve a ceasefire is now.</p>
                        <p>
                            The above conditions are also acceptable to the European Union and by extension NATO.
                            Ukrainian governance has always been very pragmatic and trade oriented and a completely
                            neutral status will fit its nature perfectly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Territorial gains of Russia are of strategic nature but Ukrainian monitoring of those
                            territories can be agreed upon. Together with dual citizenship and a special economic zone
                            status it will make the territorial disputes non-material. Eventual achievement of naval
                            power sharing agreements may reduce the tensions in the Black Sea.

                            In general, continuing the Ukrainian war is not in the interests of any parties that are
                            involved. Ultimately loss of human life or limb in any war was never justified. This is
                            amplified by the fact Russia and especially Ukraine are in demographic collapse.

                        <p>
                            The core objectives of the Russian military have been met. It achieved its vital goal of
                            checking uncontrolled expansion of NATO to the East. It also achieved its core strategic
                            territorial gains.

                        <p>
                            On the opposite side of the conflict NATO's proving its relevance to the Western public,
                            thus fulfilling its vital goal. The European armies are on the path of strengthening and
                            further integration, making Europe more capable of defending itself. A neutral Ukraine will
                            also act as a buffer, protecting the EU from direct Russian attacks on Romania and to and
                            extend Poland.

                        <p>
                            From a global perspective, the US is not interested in full integration of Russia and China
                            and stopping the conflict now is also in its interests. It also achieved the goal of getting
                            the rest of the NATO countries to invest in their defence and reduce the strain on the US,
                            while renewing ties with EU member nations. China achieved closer security integration with
                            Russia. At the same time it wants to avoid a direct confrontation with NATO and maintain
                            relations with Europe.

                        <p>
                            Not pursuing a ceasefire in Ukraine will have negative implications for each of the parties
                            involved and for the world as a whole. Now is the time for a sustained peace effort in
                            Ukraine.
