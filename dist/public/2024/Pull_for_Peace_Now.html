                            As the wars rage and the Middle East is on the verge of a wider
                            conflict there is hope for peace. Now more than ever it is time
                            to pull for it.

                        <h2>Sudan</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the next four months, <a
                               href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/sudan/uaes-secret-war-sudan">two
                                and a half million Sudanese could die of hunger-related
                                causes</a>. Urgent action to stop the war is needed NOW!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was subjected to a drone strike
                            yesterday. Now the Swiss-brokered peace talks are at a risk of
                            failure. But stopping the war is possible. The general dynamics of
                            the situation in the region look favorable. The leadership of the
                            UAE talked with the army leadership of Sudan. Ethiopia's leadership
                            brokered the call. This is a very promising development given that
                            Ethiopia is Sudan's long-time political and military rival and the
                            UAE previously took an open-market stance on its arms sales. These
                            could be early signs of a re-arrangement of regional ties in North
                            East Africa and the Middle East. Once the external forces of the
                            war in Sudan come to an agreement the chances for peace in the
                            country will increase greatly.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Gaza</h2>
                        <p>
                            The situation of the civilian population of Gaza is dire, little aid
                            is making it in. Urgent action must be taken to allow increased
                            flow of food, medicine, and basic necessities into the sector.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The peace talks stalled. As Israel special forces continue to
                            assassinate Hamas leadership in an unwavering resolve to prevent any
                            future Hamas terror attack, Iran is being drawn into the conflict.
                            Turkey is also threatening intervention. Israeli leadership is set
                            on achieving total victory in Gaza but there is also a great
                            international push to achieve peace. Iran has been very wise in its
                            responses to Israeli attacks so far and there certainly is hope that
                            it will yet again demonstrate such wisdom now. The fact that Turkey
                            is threatening military action and blocking NATO aid to Israel is
                            putting additional pressure on Israel to allow to improve
                            the humanitarian situation in Gaza and initiate a ceasefire.

                        <h2>Ukraine</h2>
                        <p>
                            RAF continues to push the front line and the potential shelling and
                            drone attacks away from the city Donetsk,
                            inflicting heavy losses on AFU with its outweighing arsenal and
                            might. In turn AFU is trying to keep as much of its internationally
                            recognized but now disputed territory as possible and reports
                            inflicting heavy losses on RAF. At the same time, both sides have
                            been slowly moving their peace-making positions closer to a solution
                            that would be acceptable to the collective West and the RF.
                        </p>
                        <h2>One long-term solution</h2>
                        <p>
                            In all three conflicts, the civilian population continues to suffer
                            greatly. Progress appears to be blocked, in part due to the world
                            waiting for
                            the resolution of the political future of the USA, the center of the
                            present global economic and security systems. It is difficult to
                            make peace deals before knowing what the future position of the most
                            influential region of the world will be. Difficult but not
                            impossible.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Inter-regional balance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Strengthening ALL regional blocks is the way forward. Now more than ever
                            we are closer to building co-lateral regional unification, without war
                            causing hegemony of a leading constituent. Strengthening the positions
                            of all parts of the world will lead to a new balance of forces, where no
                            one region can significantly destabilize any other one. It is an
                            achievable scenario that fits the best interests of the world
                            populations, the national elites, and the international economic elites.
                        </p>
                        <h3>It is possible</h3>
                        <p>
                            Africa is the key region of the world that all depend on, from South
                            America to Southeast Asia. Unifying Africa may appear impossible but the
                            upcoming technological developments will profoundly impact our
                            ability to build transportation links, agricultural capacity, and
                            industrial infrastructure. It will take significant time for African
                            nations to unify but regional integration with strong internal
                            transportation networks will become a reality sooner than we now think
                            possible. And with more time the unyielding march of progress
                            will enable cross-continental transportation and economic integration,
                            making the "Africa Unite" dream a reality.

                            Yet, to separate Africa from the Middle East is to split sub-Saharan
                            Africa away. Thus integration of the Arab peninsula with North East
                            Africa is the way towards unlocking the key bridging potential of the
                            Middle East & Afghanistan region. A way that has long-term prospects for
                            inter-regional and eventually global conflict reduction and stability.

                        <p>
                            The resolution of the war in Sudan will lead to greater integration and
                            stability of the Red Sea/North East Africa region. The Middle East is
                            now painfully going through a reduction of external influence, and the
                            deadly risks of a regional escalation will lead to a drive for peace,
                            despite any external drivers or internal divisions. Given the momentum
                            before the Gaza war, when it is stopped there will be a push for greater
                            regional integration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fate of Ukraine is now geographically set to being the
                            borderlands between two regional blocks. Now is the time to focus
                            on securing peace in the country, a peace that would be acceptable
                            and even beneficial to both the West and the East.

                        <h2>Starting combat non-lethality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Outside of the EU-CIS conflict in the North we are seeing unprecedented
                            cross-regional cooperation. It will drive forward limitation of
                            future conflicts, and combined with the steadily emerging, ubiquitous
                            regional unity will help to pull us towards limiting combat lethality to
                            the greatest possible extent. We are being given the perfect opportunity
                            to lay
                            the foundation of future rules of engagement, at the highest and widest
                            level possible. Without them we would be quickly approaching a
                            version of our world in which autonomous swarms of drones to
                            dominate the battlefield. Such a scenario is no far away from
                            already envisioned enslavement of humanity, and is further
                            enabled by the upcoming robotization of mining, logistics and
                            manufacturing. Non-lethal combat is the way forward as we may not be
                            capable of achieving world peace in the near term.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is becoming apparent that no matter the perspective or the
                            expectation of future developments we are at a cornerstone
                            moment in history. Now is time to set the framework
                            for limiting future conflicts, between regions and between countries
                            within those regions. Lets get it done while achieving peace!
